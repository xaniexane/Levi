# Secrets in Code Defense for Mobile Devices (MDM) in Branch Offices (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

API keys, passwords, and tokens committed to repositories get scraped by attackers (and by every future repo reader). A committed secret is a compromised secret — rotate first, clean history second. Applies to Mobile Devices (MDM) in Branch Offices at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- Secret-scanning alerts (push protection or historical scan) flagging keys, tokens, or private keys in commits.
- Anomalous API usage billed to a key that appears in a repository, or commits adding '.env' files.
- Public repository exposure: any secret ever pushed public is considered harvested.
- Lens: Best telemetry: MDM compliance/app inventory + mobile threat defense alerts + enrollment logs. SD-WAN/branch firewall logs forwarded centrally; local DHCP/DNS logs for device attribution.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NAC or port-level logs identifying which device was on which port during the incident.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in MDM device inventory: OS versions, jailbreak/root detections, installed app lists and Mobile threat defense alerts (malicious apps, network attacks, OS tampering); run `# conceptually (MDM APIs differ):` then `mdm-cli devices list --noncompliant --limit 30`.
3. **Analyze.** For each exposed secret: determine its privileges and check usage logs for unauthorized use since exposure. Then: Check git history depth: secrets in old commits are still exposed to anyone with repo access.
4. **Contain and harden.** Rotate the secret FIRST, then purge from history; enable push protection and pre-commit secret scanning. Asset layer: Enrollment required for corporate data, OS version minimums, jailbreak/root = automatic quarantine. Environment layer: Standardized branch firewall policy deployed as code; no local admin exceptions.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Deleting the commit without rotating — the secret is already copied.
- Scanning only main branch; secrets hide in feature branches, PRs, and forks.
