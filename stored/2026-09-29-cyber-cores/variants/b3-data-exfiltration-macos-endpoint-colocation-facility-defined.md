# Data Exfiltration Defense for macOS Endpoints in Colocation Facilities (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Sensitive data leaving the network — the moment an intrusion becomes a breach. Quantifying WHAT left is more important than blocking the channel after the fact; notification obligations depend on the data, not the technique. Applies to macOS Endpoints in Colocation Facilities at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- Egress spikes: large uploads to external hosts, cloud storage, or paste sites from servers that normally receive more than they send.
- Staging activity: large archives (zip/7z/rar) created in temp directories, database dumps, or mailbox exports shortly before the transfer.
- DLP alerts on regulated data patterns (SSN, card numbers, PHI formats) in outbound traffic, or DNS/ICMP exfil at low volume.
- Lens: Best telemetry: unified log + EDR agent + Santa/Munki logs where deployed. Customer-owned network taps and logging (the colo provider's logs are out of scope — verify contractually).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Badge/physical access logs from the facility correlated with remote-hand ticket times.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Unified log (log show) for process execution and auth events; login items and LaunchAgents/LaunchDaemons plists and Quarantine attributes (xattr com.apple.quarantine) on downloads; Gatekeeper assessment history; run `log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "sshd"' --last 2h | tail -20` then `ls -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ /Library/LaunchDaemons/ /Library/LaunchAgents/ 2>/dev/null`.
3. **Analyze.** Reconstruct the exfil set: source paths, file types, record counts, and data classification — involve legal early for notification scoping. Then: Preserve full packet/proxy logs of the transfer; they prove what left and are evidence for regulators and law enforcement.
4. **Contain and harden.** DLP policies with blocking on bulk sensitive-data egress, plus alerting on archive creation and database dump commands. Asset layer: Gatekeeper + XProtect current, FileVault on, firewall on, and MDM-enforced configuration profiles. Environment layer: Locked cabinets, private cages, and escort policies for remote hands.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Stopping the transfer but never determining what was in it — you cannot scope a breach on 'we blocked something'.
- Forgetting cloud audit logs: exfil via sanctioned SaaS (personal Drive, Dropbox) bypasses network DLP.
