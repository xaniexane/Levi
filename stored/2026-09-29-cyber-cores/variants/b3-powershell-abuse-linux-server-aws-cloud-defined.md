# Malicious PowerShell Abuse Defense for Linux Servers in AWS Cloud (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

PowerShell is the attacker's Swiss-army knife: encoded commands, in-memory execution, credential theft, lateral movement. Deep script-block and module logging turns it from a blind spot into one of your richest telemetry sources. Applies to Linux Servers in AWS Cloud at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- Event 4104 (script block logging) with encoded commands (-enc/-e), Invoke-Mimikatz/Invoke-Shellcode patterns, or obfuscation (heavy string concatenation, char codes).
- PowerShell spawned by Office, browsers, or WMI with hidden window styles, or AMSI bypass patterns in the script text.
- Module logging showing credential-access or AD-enumeration cmdlets from non-admin workstations.
- Lens: Best telemetry: auditd + centralized syslog/journald + osquery or an EDR agent. Organization CloudTrail in all regions, GuardDuty, and VPC flow logs shipped to the security account.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to CloudWatch and workload logs centralized; S3 access logging on sensitive buckets.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in auth.log/secure (SSH logons), auditd logs (execve, file writes), and cron tables (/etc/crontab, /etc/cron.d/*, user crontabs) and systemd unit files in /etc/systemd/system/ and SSH authorized_keys files for all users; run `sudo grep -E 'Failed|Accepted' /var/log/auth.log | tail -40` then `sudo ausearch -m EXECVE --start recent -i | grep -E 'curl|wget|bash|sh|python|perl' | tail -30`.
3. **Analyze.** Decode every obfuscated layer — the final script reveals the true objective (many 'downloaders' are actually ransomware staging). Then: Correlate the PowerShell session with its parent to find the delivery vector (macro, scheduled task, remote session).
4. **Contain and harden.** Enable script-block logging, module logging, and transcription fleet-wide; forward to the SIEM with alerting. Asset layer: Key-only SSH (no passwords), fail2ban or equivalent, unattended security updates enabled. Environment layer: SCPs as guardrails (deny leaving org, deny disabling logging, region restrictions).
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Logging PowerShell without a SIEM pipeline to analyze it — 4104 events are high-volume and useless unsearched.
- Assuming -noprofile -w hidden is always malicious; admins use it too — baseline first.
