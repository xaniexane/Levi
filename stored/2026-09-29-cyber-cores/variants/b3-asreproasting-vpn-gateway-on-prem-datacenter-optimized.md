# ASREPRoasting Defense for VPN Gateways in On-Premises Datacenter (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Accounts with Kerberos pre-authentication disabled can have their AS-REP responses requested by anyone and cracked offline — no authentication needed at all. One misconfigured user account is enough. Applies to VPN Gateways in On-Premises Datacenter at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- 4768 (TGT request) events where pre-authentication was not used, from external or unexpected hosts, for accounts flagged DONT_REQ_PREAUTH.
- Enumeration of such accounts (LDAP queries for userAccountControl flags) preceding the roast requests.
- Later logons with the cracked credentials from attacker hosts.
- Lens: Best telemetry: authentication logs + session logs (user, IP, bytes, duration) + gateway patch state. Full network tap/SPAN coverage at core and distribution layers feeding IDS and full-packet capture.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Centralized syslog from all infrastructure with NTP-synced timestamps for cross-device correlation.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in VPN auth logs (success/failure per user with source IPs), session tables with data volumes and Gateway admin audit log and firmware/patch version; client version inventory; run `# conceptually (vendor CLIs differ):` then `show vpn-sessiondb detail anyconnect | grep -E 'Username|Assigned IP|Login Time'`.
3. **Analyze.** Enumerate all accounts with pre-auth disabled (the full roast-able population) — the fix is one checkbox per account, so find them all. Then: Check whether any of those accounts are privileged or service accounts; prioritize accordingly.
4. **Contain and harden.** Enable Kerberos pre-authentication on every account; audit for the flag regularly — it gets re-disabled by legacy app troubleshooting. Asset layer: MFA on every VPN profile, device posture checks before granting access, gateway firmware patched urgently. Environment layer: Physical access controls with badge logs correlatable to logical access during investigations.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Fixing the roasted account but not scanning for the other 40 accounts with the same misconfiguration.
- Assuming pre-auth-disabled accounts are always legacy — verify before re-enabling to avoid breaking production auth.
