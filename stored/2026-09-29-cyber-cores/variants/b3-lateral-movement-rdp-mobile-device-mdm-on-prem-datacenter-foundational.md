# RDP Lateral Movement Defense for Mobile Devices (MDM) in On-Premises Datacenter (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

RDP is both an admin tool and the attacker's favorite lateral highway. Compromised credentials plus unrestricted RDP equals domain-wide movement that looks almost legitimate in the logs. Applies to Mobile Devices (MDM) in On-Premises Datacenter at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- 4624 type-10 (RDP) logons from a workstation to servers or other workstations outside the user's normal admin pattern.
- RDP sessions at unusual hours, from hosts the account never logged into before, or with clipboard/drive redirection moving tools onto the target.
- TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager events (21/25) on targets without a matching helpdesk ticket or change record.
- Lens: Best telemetry: MDM compliance/app inventory + mobile threat defense alerts + enrollment logs. Full network tap/SPAN coverage at core and distribution layers feeding IDS and full-packet capture.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Centralized syslog from all infrastructure with NTP-synced timestamps for cross-device correlation.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in MDM device inventory: OS versions, jailbreak/root detections, installed app lists and Mobile threat defense alerts (malicious apps, network attacks, OS tampering); run `# conceptually (MDM APIs differ):` then `mdm-cli devices list --noncompliant --limit 30`.
3. **Analyze.** Correlate RDP logons with the source host's compromise timeline to distinguish attacker sessions from legitimate admin work. Then: Check for credential harvesting on each RDP target: LSASS access or SAM reads following the session indicate theft.
4. **Contain and harden.** RDP restricted to jump hosts/bastions with MFA; Network Level Authentication enforced; no direct workstation-to-server RDP. Asset layer: Enrollment required for corporate data, OS version minimums, jailbreak/root = automatic quarantine. Environment layer: Physical access controls with badge logs correlatable to logical access during investigations.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Allowing 'temporary' RDP exceptions that become permanent lateral paths.
- Missing RDP-based movement because you only hunted SMB — attackers use whatever is open.
