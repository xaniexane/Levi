# SMB Lateral Movement Defense for Azure Subscriptions in GCP Cloud (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers move host-to-host over SMB using stolen credentials — PsExec-style service creation, admin shares, or WMI. In a flat network, one compromised workstation becomes the whole domain in hours. Applies to Azure Subscriptions in GCP Cloud at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- SMB sessions from a workstation to many other hosts in a short window, especially to ADMIN$ or C$ shares the user never touches normally.
- Service creation events (7045) with service binaries in ADMIN$\system32, or 4624 type-3 logons with the same account across dozens of hosts.
- EDR process trees showing services.exe spawning cmd/powershell shortly after a remote SMB session.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Activity Log + Entra sign-in logs + Defender for Cloud + NSG flow logs. Cloud Audit Logs (admin + data access) exported to a locked-down logging project.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Security Command Center findings and VPC flow logs centralized.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Azure Activity Log (write/delete on IAM, policy, network) and Entra audit/sign-in logs and Defender for Cloud recommendations and alerts; resource-change history; run `az monitor activity-log list --max-events 25 --query '[].{time:eventTimestamp, op:operationName.value, caller:caller}' -o table` then `az security alert list --query '[].{name:alertDisplayName, severity:severity, time:timeGeneratedUtc}' -o table`.
3. **Analyze.** Map the movement graph: source host, credential used, target hosts, timestamps — this is the incident's skeleton. Then: Determine which credential enabled it (stolen hash, ticket, or plaintext) to know what must be rotated enterprise-wide.
4. **Contain and harden.** Segment the network (workstation-to-workstation SMB blocked), deploy LAPS for unique local admin passwords, and restrict lateral logon rights via tiered admin model. Asset layer: Azure Policy deny-effects on public storage/exposure; PIM for subscription roles; Defender plans on. Environment layer: Organization policies constraining public exposure, API enablement, and service-account key creation.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Cleaning patient zero while the attacker's beachheads on hosts 3, 7, and 12 remain active.
- Rotating the compromised account's password but not the kerberos tickets/hashes already stolen from it.
