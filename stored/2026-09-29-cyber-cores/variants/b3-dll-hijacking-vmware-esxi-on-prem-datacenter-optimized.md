# DLL Hijacking Defense for VMware ESXi Hosts in On-Premises Datacenter (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Applications loading DLLs from insecure paths let attackers plant a malicious DLL that executes with the application's privileges. Detection focuses on DLL loads from writable directories and known-vulnerable applications. Applies to VMware ESXi Hosts in On-Premises Datacenter at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- Sysmon event 7 (image loaded) showing DLLs loaded from temp, downloads, or user-writable directories by privileged processes.
- New DLL files appearing alongside application executables, especially with names matching system DLLs.
- Application crashes or behavior changes after a DLL appears in its directory.
- Lens: Best telemetry: vCenter tasks/events + ESXi syslog + lockdown-mode audit. Full network tap/SPAN coverage at core and distribution layers feeding IDS and full-packet capture.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Centralized syslog from all infrastructure with NTP-synced timestamps for cross-device correlation.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in vCenter tasks and events (VM power ops, snapshot create/delete, host profile changes) and ESXi hostd/vpxa logs and shell-access records; VM .vmx changes; run `esxcli system auditrecords local list | tail -20` then `vim-cmd vmsvc/getallvms 2>/dev/null | head -20`.
3. **Analyze.** Verify the loading order: confirm the planted DLL shadows a legitimate one via PATH or application-directory precedence. Then: Check the DLL's exports and behavior in a sandbox — many hijack DLLs proxy the original to stay stealthy.
4. **Contain and harden.** Applications should use absolute paths and SafeDllSearchMode; remove user-writable directories from the DLL search order. Asset layer: Lockdown mode on, isolated management network, unique per-host root passwords, MFA on vCenter. Environment layer: Physical access controls with badge logs correlatable to logical access during investigations.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Deleting the DLL without fixing the insecure load order — the hole remains for the next attacker.
- Assuming signed applications are immune; the signature covers the EXE, not the DLL it loads.
