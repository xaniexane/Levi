# Password Spraying Defense for File Servers in Hybrid Cloud (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers try a small set of common passwords against many usernames, staying under per-account lockout thresholds. It is quieter than stuffing and specifically tuned to evade lockout policies, often running for days or weeks. Applies to File Servers in Hybrid Cloud at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- A handful of failed logons per account (1-3) spread across hundreds of accounts from one or a few IPs, repeating on a schedule — the classic low-and-slow pattern.
- The same few passwords attempted everywhere (SeasonYear!, Company123, Password1); check by aggregating failed-logon password hashes where your IdP logs them.
- Spray bursts correlated with newly published password lists or timed to holidays/weekends when response is slower.
- Lens: Best telemetry: object-access auditing (who opened/modified what) + share-permission reviews. Unified SIEM ingesting both on-prem syslog and cloud audit trails with identity correlation across both.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Conditional-access and network logs covering the interconnect (ExpressRoute/Direct Connect/VPN).

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in File-access audit events (4663/4656 on Windows; auditd on Linux) for sensitive shares and Share and NTFS/ACL permission exports; recent permission-change events; run `Get-SmbShare | Select-Object Name, Path, Description; echo ---; Get-SmbShareAccess -Name <share>` then `Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; Id=4663} -MaxEvents 100 | Group-Object {$_.Properties[1].Value} | Sort-Object Count -Descending | Select-Object -First 10 Name, Count`.
3. **Analyze.** Reconstruct the spray window: first-seen to last-seen per source IP, and list every account with even one success inside the window — those are confirmed or suspected takeovers. Then: Check whether sprayed accounts share traits (same OU, same onboarding batch, service accounts) to find how the username list was built.
4. **Contain and harden.** Smart lockout (soft lockout with increasing delays) plus alerting on distributed low-volume failures, not just lockouts. Asset layer: Access-based enumeration, least-privilege share/NTFS rights, no Everyone:Full Control anywhere. Environment layer: Consistent identity (single IdP) across on-prem and cloud; no parallel credential stores.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Per-account lockout thresholds alone will not catch spraying; you need cross-account velocity detection.
- Treating one success as an isolated incident misses the campaign — always scope the full spray window.
