# Golden Ticket Attack Defense for Secrets Vaults in Multi-Cloud (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Forged Kerberos TGTs using the stolen krbtgt hash grant unrestricted, long-lived domain access that survives password resets. Detection relies on ticket anomalies: impossible lifetimes, wrong encryption, or logons that bypass the DC. Applies to Secrets Vaults in Multi-Cloud at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- TGTs with lifetimes far exceeding domain policy (e.g., 10 years), RC4-encrypted tickets in an AES-enforced domain, or tickets for accounts that never authenticated (no 4768).
- 4769 service-ticket requests referencing a TGT the DC never issued, or logons from hosts with no corresponding interactive session.
- The krbtgt account's own anomalous activity following a DCSync event.
- Lens: Best telemetry: secret access audit (who read what, when) + policy-change audit + unseal events. Cloud-agnostic SIEM normalizing AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Log, and GCP Audit Logs into one schema.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to CSPM coverage across all clouds with consistent misconfiguration alerting.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Audit log of secret reads/writes/deletes with client identity and source IP and Policy and auth-method changes; root-token generation events; run `vault audit log --since 24h 2>/dev/null | grep -E '"path":"secret' | head -20` then `vault list sys/policy 2>/dev/null; vault auth list 2>/dev/null`.
3. **Analyze.** Confirm via ticket inspection (klist, network capture): lifetime, encryption type, and client name mismatches prove forgery. Then: Scope everything done under forged tickets — assume full domain compromise until proven otherwise.
4. **Contain and harden.** Rotate the krbtgt password TWICE (to invalidate both current and previous hash) after any suspected compromise. Asset layer: Short-lived dynamic secrets, no static long-lived tokens, MFA on UI access, sealed storage backend. Environment layer: Federated identity across clouds from one IdP; consistent tagging and logging standards per cloud.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Rotating krbtgt only once — the N-1 hash remains valid and the golden ticket still works.
- Treating it as an account incident instead of a domain-trust incident; the response scope is the whole forest.
