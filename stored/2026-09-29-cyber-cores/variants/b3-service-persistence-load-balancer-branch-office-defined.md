# Malicious Service Persistence Defense for Load Balancers in Branch Offices (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers install or hijack Windows services for SYSTEM-level, reboot-surviving execution. Services are trusted by admins, so malicious ones hide with plausible names — verify the binary, not the display name. Applies to Load Balancers in Branch Offices at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- 7045 (service installed) with ImagePath in user-writable or temp directories, unsigned binaries, or names mimicking legit services.
- Existing service ImagePath changed (7045 with same name, new binary) or service binary replaced on disk.
- Services running as SYSTEM that were recently created and have no vendor documentation or change record.
- Lens: Best telemetry: access logs with X-Forwarded-For + backend health flaps + config-change audit. SD-WAN/branch firewall logs forwarded centrally; local DHCP/DNS logs for device attribution.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NAC or port-level logs identifying which device was on which port during the incident.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Access logs (client IP, Host header, URI, status, bytes) — the edge view of web attacks and Backend pool changes and health-check failure histories; run `grep -E ' 4[0-9]{2} ' /var/log/haproxy.log | awk '{print $6}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -15` then `echo 'show stat' | socat unix-connect:/var/run/haproxy.sock stdio 2>/dev/null | cut -d, -f1,2,18 | head -20`.
3. **Analyze.** Hash and detonate the service binary; check its signature status and first-seen date in threat intel. Then: Review the service account: LocalSystem services have maximum impact — scope accordingly.
4. **Contain and harden.** Alert on all 7045 events; require change tickets for new services and run services as least-privilege virtual accounts. Asset layer: TLS 1.2+ with strong ciphers, HSTS, WAF integration at the edge, config changes via version control. Environment layer: Standardized branch firewall policy deployed as code; no local admin exceptions.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Stopping the service without deleting it — it restarts on reboot.
- Missing service DLL hijacking (Services with ServiceDll in writable paths) while hunting only EXE-based services.
