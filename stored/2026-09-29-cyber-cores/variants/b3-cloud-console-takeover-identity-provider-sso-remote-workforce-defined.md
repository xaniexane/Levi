# Cloud Console Takeover Defense for SSO Identity Providers in Remote Workforce (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Stolen cloud credentials used in the web console give attackers point-and-click infrastructure control. Console logons from unusual locations followed by IAM changes are the classic takeover sequence. Applies to SSO Identity Providers in Remote Workforce at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- CloudTrail/Entra sign-in logs showing console logons from new countries or anonymizing services for privileged users.
- IAM policy changes, new access keys, or new users created within minutes of the anomalous logon.
- Disabling of CloudTrail/logging or deletion of log data — the attacker covering tracks.
- Lens: Best telemetry: authentication logs with MFA detail + app-assignment changes + federation trust changes. EDR on every endpoint as the primary sensor (no corporate network tap for remote hosts).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to VPN/ZTNA access logs and SaaS/IdP sign-in logs as the network-visibility substitute.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Authentication logs per application (success/failure, MFA method, device, location) and Application assignment and provisioning logs; new SSO integrations; run `# conceptually (IdP APIs differ):` then `idp-cli logs auth --user <upn> --last 7d --format table | head -25`.
3. **Analyze.** Reconstruct the full API call sequence after takeover: what was created, modified, exfiltrated, or destroyed. Then: Check for persistence: new IAM users, roles with trust policies pointing outward, or modified instance user-data.
4. **Contain and harden.** Phishing-resistant MFA on all console users, especially root/ break-glass; SCPs preventing logging disablement. Asset layer: Phishing-resistant MFA default, sign-on policies per app risk, session lifetime limits. Environment layer: Zero-trust access: device compliance + MFA per application, not per network.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Rotating the compromised user's keys but missing the backdoor IAM role the attacker created.
- Trusting the account's own logs after the attacker had admin — verify against the immutable archive.
