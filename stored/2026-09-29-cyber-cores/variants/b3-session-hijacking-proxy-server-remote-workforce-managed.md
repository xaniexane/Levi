# Web Session Hijacking Defense for Proxy Servers in Remote Workforce (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Stolen session cookies let attackers ride authenticated web sessions without credentials or MFA. Cookie theft via infostealer or XSS is the usual source; concurrent-session anomalies are the usual signal. Applies to Proxy Servers in Remote Workforce at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- The same session active from two geographies or ASNs simultaneously, or a session suddenly continuing from a datacenter IP.
- Session created without a fresh authentication event (cookie replay), or user-agent/IP changing mid-session.
- Infostealer execution on the user's device shortly before the anomalous session.
- Lens: Best telemetry: full URL logs with user identity + TLS SNI logs + block/allow verdicts. EDR on every endpoint as the primary sensor (no corporate network tap for remote hosts).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to VPN/ZTNA access logs and SaaS/IdP sign-in logs as the network-visibility substitute.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Access logs (user, URL, category, verdict, bytes) for the incident window and Blocked-request logs showing attempted C2/malware/phishing destinations; run `grep <username> /var/log/squid/access.log | awk '{print $7}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20` then `grep -E 'TCP_DENIED|BLOCK' /var/log/squid/access.log | tail -30`.
3. **Analyze.** Determine the theft vector: device compromise (cookie files exfiltrated) versus application XSS — the fix differs. Then: Inventory actions taken in the hijacked session: data viewed, settings changed, transactions performed.
4. **Contain and harden.** Short session lifetimes, binding sessions to device/IP characteristics, and step-up auth for sensitive actions. Asset layer: Authenticated proxying (no anonymous egress), category blocking, TLS inspection where policy allows. Environment layer: Zero-trust access: device compliance + MFA per application, not per network.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Invalidating the password but not the session — the hijacker stays logged in.
- Missing that the user's DEVICE is compromised; the next session gets stolen too until the infostealer is removed.
