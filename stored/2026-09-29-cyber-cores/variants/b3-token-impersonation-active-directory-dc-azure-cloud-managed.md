# Token Impersonation Defense for Active Directory Domain Controllers in Azure Cloud (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers steal or duplicate Windows access tokens to act as another user — often SYSTEM — without knowing any password. EDR sees odd parent/child relationships and token-privilege enabling that legitimate software rarely performs. Applies to Active Directory Domain Controllers in Azure Cloud at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- Processes enabling SeDebugPrivilege or SeImpersonatePrivilege outside of known admin tooling, or unexpected token duplication API sequences in EDR telemetry.
- A low-privilege process spawning children as SYSTEM or as another logged-on user without a legitimate service path.
- Named-pipe impersonation patterns (PrintSpooler-style) from non-printer processes.
- Lens: Best telemetry: forwarded Security logs (4768/4769/4771/4662/4720/4732/4724/5136) + AD replication monitoring. Activity Log and Entra sign-in/audit logs streamed to Log Analytics/SIEM; Defender for Cloud alerts.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NSG flow logs and storage analytics for data-plane visibility.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Security log Kerberos events (4768 TGT requests, 4769 service tickets, 4771 pre-auth failures) and Directory-service change events (5136/5137) and replication metadata (repadmin /showobjmeta); run `repadmin /showrepl | Select-String -Pattern 'error|fail' -Context 2` then `Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; Id=4769} -MaxEvents 200 | Group-Object {$_.Properties[0].Value} | Sort-Object Count -Descending | Select-Object -First 10 Name, Count`.
3. **Analyze.** Trace the token source: which process's token was stolen, and did that source process itself get compromised first? Then: Check what the impersonated context accessed — file, registry, and network actions taken as the victim identity.
4. **Contain and harden.** Remove SeImpersonatePrivilege from service accounts that do not need it; patch print-spooler-class vulnerabilities promptly. Asset layer: Tier-zero isolation: DCs on dedicated hosts, no browsing/email, admin access via PAW/jump host only. Environment layer: Azure Policy deny-effects on risky configurations; PIM-gated subscription roles.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Assuming token theft requires admin — some impersonation primitives work from lower privilege.
- Missing that a stolen token can be replayed on OTHER hosts via remote authentication.
