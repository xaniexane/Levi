# Double-Extortion Ransomware Defense for AWS Accounts in Hybrid Cloud (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Data is exfiltrated BEFORE encryption, so the attacker can leak it even if you restore from backups. The investigation must answer what was stolen, not just what was encrypted — breach notification clocks start on exfiltration. Applies to AWS Accounts in Hybrid Cloud at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- Large outbound transfers (tens of GB) to cloud storage, file shares, or anonymized endpoints in the days before encryption, often via rclone, MEGAsync, or custom tooling.
- Staging directories with archived/renamed sensitive data (databases, file shares zipped) and data-leak-site monitoring hits for your organization name.
- The ransom note references specific stolen files or threatens publication with a countdown timer.
- Lens: Best telemetry: CloudTrail (org trail, all regions) + GuardDuty + VPC flow logs + Config. Unified SIEM ingesting both on-prem syslog and cloud audit trails with identity correlation across both.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Conditional-access and network logs covering the interconnect (ExpressRoute/Direct Connect/VPN).

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in CloudTrail event history (console logons, IAM changes, AssumeRole, security-group changes) and GuardDuty findings, IAM Access Analyzer results, and S3 server-access logs for data stores; run `aws cloudtrail lookup-events --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=EventName,AttributeValue=ConsoleLogin --max-items 20` then `aws iam generate-credential-report && aws iam get-credential-report --query Content --output text | base64 -d | head -5`.
3. **Analyze.** Quantify the exfil: source directories, file types, record counts, and whether regulated data (PII, PHI, card data) was included — this drives notification obligations. Then: Preserve exfiltration logs (proxy, firewall, DLP, cloud audit) as evidence; they are also the proof of what did and did not leave.
4. **Contain and harden.** DLP egress policies on sensitive data stores plus alerting on bulk archive creation and large outbound transfers. Asset layer: MFA on root + all IAM users, SCPs denying logging disablement and unapproved regions, no long-lived keys. Environment layer: Consistent identity (single IdP) across on-prem and cloud; no parallel credential stores.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Declaring victory after restoring from backup while stolen data sits on a leak site — the extortion continues.
- Starting the notification clock at encryption time instead of at first confirmed exfiltration.
