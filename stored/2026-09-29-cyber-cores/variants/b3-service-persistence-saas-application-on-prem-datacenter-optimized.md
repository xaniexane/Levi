# Malicious Service Persistence Defense for SaaS Applications in On-Premises Datacenter (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers install or hijack Windows services for SYSTEM-level, reboot-surviving execution. Services are trusted by admins, so malicious ones hide with plausible names — verify the binary, not the display name. Applies to SaaS Applications in On-Premises Datacenter at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- 7045 (service installed) with ImagePath in user-writable or temp directories, unsigned binaries, or names mimicking legit services.
- Existing service ImagePath changed (7045 with same name, new binary) or service binary replaced on disk.
- Services running as SYSTEM that were recently created and have no vendor documentation or change record.
- Lens: Best telemetry: SaaS audit logs (admin + user activity) streamed to SIEM + SSO logs. Full network tap/SPAN coverage at core and distribution layers feeding IDS and full-packet capture.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Centralized syslog from all infrastructure with NTP-synced timestamps for cross-device correlation.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Admin audit log (settings changes, user provisioning, sharing changes) and User activity logs: file access, downloads, external sharing events; run `# conceptually (SaaS APIs differ):` then `saas-cli audit log --category admin --last 7d --format table | head -25`.
3. **Analyze.** Hash and detonate the service binary; check its signature status and first-seen date in threat intel. Then: Review the service account: LocalSystem services have maximum impact — scope accordingly.
4. **Contain and harden.** Alert on all 7045 events; require change tickets for new services and run services as least-privilege virtual accounts. Asset layer: SSO with MFA enforced, SCIM provisioning, least-privilege roles, external-sharing restricted. Environment layer: Physical access controls with badge logs correlatable to logical access during investigations.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Stopping the service without deleting it — it restarts on reboot.
- Missing service DLL hijacking (Services with ServiceDll in writable paths) while hunting only EXE-based services.
