# Kerberoasting Defense for Linux Workstations in GCP Cloud (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers request service tickets for SPN accounts and crack them offline to recover service-account passwords — no alerts on the DC, because requesting tickets is normal. The defense is making those passwords uncrackable and the requests visible. Applies to Linux Workstations in GCP Cloud at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- A single account requesting an unusual number of service tickets (4769) with RC4 encryption for many different SPNs in a short window.
- Ticket requests for SPNs from accounts with no business need, or requests at odd hours from a workstation (not a server).
- Subsequent use of a cracked service account: logons from unexpected hosts or privilege changes for that account.
- Lens: Best telemetry: auditd user-session logging + EDR agent + desktop shell histories (with user notice). Cloud Audit Logs (admin + data access) exported to a locked-down logging project.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Security Command Center findings and VPC flow logs centralized.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in User shell histories (~/.bash_history), desktop autostart entries (~/.config/autostart/) and auditd execve logs and USB device logs; browser profiles for web-vector cases; run `ls -la ~/.config/autostart/ 2>/dev/null; grep -r 'Exec=' ~/.config/autostart/ 2>/dev/null` then `sudo ausearch --start recent -m EXECVE -i | tail -30`.
3. **Analyze.** List every SPN targeted and assess the crackability of each service account's password (length, complexity, age). Then: If a service account was cracked, treat it as full compromise: inventory everything that account could touch.
4. **Contain and harden.** Service accounts: 25+ character random passwords, or better, group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) with automatic rotation. Asset layer: Standard user accounts for daily work, full-disk encryption, and screen-lock enforcement. Environment layer: Organization policies constraining public exposure, API enablement, and service-account key creation.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Rotating the password but leaving the SPN on a weak account — the attacker just roasts it again.
- Missing that the cracked service account may have been used to request MORE tickets (roast chaining).
