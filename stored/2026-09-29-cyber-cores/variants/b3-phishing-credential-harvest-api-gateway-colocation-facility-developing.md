# Phishing Credential Harvest Defense for API Gateways in Colocation Facilities (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Users are lured to lookalike login pages (often via adversary-in-the-middle kits that relay MFA) and submit credentials. The defender's job: find who clicked, who submitted, and whether sessions were hijacked even where MFA appeared to hold. Applies to API Gateways in Colocation Facilities at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- Email gateway logs show a burst of messages with lookalike domains, newly registered domains, or QR-code lures pointing at a credential-harvest kit URL.
- Proxy/DNS logs show visits to the kit domain followed within minutes by logons from unusual IPs or impossible-travel pairs for the same user.
- AiTM kits leave telltales: logon session created without a matching MFA challenge event, or token replay from datacenter IP ranges.
- Lens: Best telemetry: per-request logs with API key/identity, endpoint, params hash, and response size. Customer-owned network taps and logging (the colo provider's logs are out of scope — verify contractually).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Badge/physical access logs from the facility correlated with remote-hand ticket times.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Gateway access logs with authenticated identity per call; rate-limit trigger logs and Schema-validation failure logs (attacks often start as malformed requests); run `grep <api-key-id> /var/log/apigw/access.log | awk '{print $7}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20` then `grep -c 'schema_validation_failed' /var/log/apigw/error.log`.
3. **Analyze.** Pull the kit URL from the email, fetch it in a sandbox, and extract the credential-post endpoint and any session-cookie exfiltration to scope which submissions completed. Then: For each submitter, check for concurrent sessions: revoke all refresh tokens and list OAuth app consents granted in the phish window.
4. **Contain and harden.** Move to phishing-resistant MFA (FIDO2/WebAuthn); TOTP and push MFA fall to AiTM relay. Asset layer: Positive-security policies: schema validation, per-client rate limits, OAuth scopes per endpoint. Environment layer: Locked cabinets, private cages, and escort policies for remote hands.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Resetting the password without revoking sessions leaves the attacker logged in via stolen tokens.
- Blaming the clicker instead of fixing the control gap guarantees a repeat with a better lure.
