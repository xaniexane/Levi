# Kubernetes RBAC Abuse Defense for Load Balancers in Colocation Facilities (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Overly broad Kubernetes roles let attackers escalate from a compromised pod to cluster admin. RBAC misconfigurations are the Kubernetes equivalent of AD delegation sprawl — audit them the same way. Applies to Load Balancers in Colocation Facilities at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- Pods or service accounts using cluster-admin or wildcard roles, especially ones created outside GitOps pipelines.
- Kubernetes audit logs showing service accounts listing secrets cluster-wide or creating privileged pods.
- New ClusterRoleBindings granting powerful roles to default or application service accounts.
- Lens: Best telemetry: access logs with X-Forwarded-For + backend health flaps + config-change audit. Customer-owned network taps and logging (the colo provider's logs are out of scope — verify contractually).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Badge/physical access logs from the facility correlated with remote-hand ticket times.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Access logs (client IP, Host header, URI, status, bytes) — the edge view of web attacks and Backend pool changes and health-check failure histories; run `grep -E ' 4[0-9]{2} ' /var/log/haproxy.log | awk '{print $6}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -15` then `echo 'show stat' | socat unix-connect:/var/run/haproxy.sock stdio 2>/dev/null | cut -d, -f1,2,18 | head -20`.
3. **Analyze.** Map effective permissions per service account: which can read secrets, create pods, or exec into others — that is the blast radius. Then: Check whether the abused binding was created by the attacker or pre-existing misconfiguration.
4. **Contain and harden.** Least-privilege RBAC, no wildcards, no cluster-admin for apps; manage bindings via GitOps with PR review. Asset layer: TLS 1.2+ with strong ciphers, HSTS, WAF integration at the edge, config changes via version control. Environment layer: Locked cabinets, private cages, and escort policies for remote hands.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Fixing the abused binding but leaving 50 other wildcard roles in place.
- Forgetting that a compromised pod with cloud credentials can pivot from k8s RBAC to cloud IAM.
