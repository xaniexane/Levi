# Log Tampering Defense for Windows Workstations in Air-Gapped Networks (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers clear or alter logs to blind defenders — event log clears, audit policy disabling, or timestomping. The tampering itself is evidence: treat cleared logs as confirmation of malicious activity, not as missing data. Applies to Windows Workstations in Air-Gapped Networks at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- Event 1102 (audit log cleared) or 104 (log cleared), audit policy changes disabling categories, or gaps in otherwise continuous log streams.
- Timestomped files (MFT timestamps inconsistent with sequence numbers) or syslog gaps from specific hosts.
- SIEM agent uninstalls or forwarding configuration changes.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Sysmon + EDR + PowerShell script-block logging forwarded to the SIEM. Local SIEM/log collector inside the enclave (no cloud shipping); removable-media transfer logs.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Strict allowlisting logs: every binary execution recorded, since the set is small and known.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Security event log (4624/4625 logons, 4688 process creation, 7045 service installs) and Sysmon operational log and PowerShell operational log (4104 script blocks); run `Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; Id=4625} -MaxEvents 50 | Format-List TimeCreated, @{n='TargetUser';e={$_.Properties[5].Value}}, @{n='SourceIP';e={$_.Properties[19].Value}}` then `autorunsc64.exe -accepteula -a * -c -h -s -t | findstr /v "Microsoft Corporation"`.
3. **Analyze.** The clear event's timestamp bounds the attacker's active window — focus forensic effort just before it. Then: Recover from redundant sources: EDR cloud telemetry, network logs, and central syslog often survive local clears.
4. **Contain and harden.** Forward logs off-host in real time to tamper-evident central storage; alert on 1102/104 immediately. Asset layer: Application allowlisting (WDAC/AppLocker) and LSA Protection + Credential Guard enabled. Environment layer: Data diodes or strictly controlled one-way transfers; media sanitization procedures for anything crossing.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Treating 'no logs' as 'no evidence of compromise' — absence after tampering IS the evidence.
- Relying solely on host logs; always have an independent telemetry path (network, EDR cloud).
