# WinRM Lateral Movement Defense for Hyper-V Hosts in AWS Cloud (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Windows Remote Management gives attackers remote PowerShell on any host where WinRM is enabled — quieter than PsExec, built into the OS, and often left on by default in enterprises. Applies to Hyper-V Hosts in AWS Cloud at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- WinRM operational log (Microsoft-Windows-WinRM/Operational) showing connections from non-admin workstations, or wsmprovhost spawning powershell with encoded commands.
- Event 4624 type-3 logons to the WinRM port (5985/5986) from hosts outside the management subnet.
- PowerShell remoting sessions (event 400/800) executing reconnaissance or credential-access commands.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Hyper-V-VMMS/Hyper-V-Worker event logs + host Security log + SCVMM job history. Organization CloudTrail in all regions, GuardDuty, and VPC flow logs shipped to the security account.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to CloudWatch and workload logs centralized; S3 access logging on sensitive buckets.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Microsoft-Windows-Hyper-V-VMMS event log (VM create/start/stop, checkpoint ops) and Virtual switch and virtual NIC configuration; VM configuration files and checkpoints; run `Get-WinEvent -LogName 'Microsoft-Windows-Hyper-V-VMMS-Admin' -MaxEvents 25 | Select-Object TimeCreated, Id, Message | Format-Table -Wrap` then `Get-VM | Select-Object Name, State, CheckpointType, @{n='Switch';e={(Get-VMNetworkAdapter $_).SwitchName}} | Format-Table`.
3. **Analyze.** Extract the remote commands from PowerShell operational logs (4104) on the target to see exactly what the attacker ran. Then: Inventory which hosts have WinRM enabled and reachable — the attack surface is every one of them.
4. **Contain and harden.** Restrict WinRM to management hosts via host firewall and GPO; disable where not needed. Asset layer: Dedicated management NIC/vLAN, Shielded VMs for sensitive workloads, guarded fabric where available. Environment layer: SCPs as guardrails (deny leaving org, deny disabling logging, region restrictions).
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Forgetting WinRM over HTTPS (5986) when firewalling only 5985.
- PowerShell logging gaps: without module/script-block logging, remote commands are invisible — enable both.
