# Active Directory ACL Abuse Defense for Secrets Vaults in Air-Gapped Networks (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers abuse delegated Active Directory permissions — WriteDacl, GenericAll, ForceChangePassword — to escalate without exploits. These are legitimate rights granted too broadly, so detection means auditing WHO can do WHAT, continuously. Applies to Secrets Vaults in Air-Gapped Networks at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- 4662 events showing writes to security descriptors (WriteDacl / WriteOwner) on privileged groups, OUs, or the AdminSDHolder container.
- Password resets (4724) performed by non-helpdesk accounts, or new ACEs granting GenericAll over high-value targets.
- BloodHound-style LDAP enumeration (large object reads) preceding the ACL change — the attacker mapping attack paths.
- Lens: Best telemetry: secret access audit (who read what, when) + policy-change audit + unseal events. Local SIEM/log collector inside the enclave (no cloud shipping); removable-media transfer logs.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Strict allowlisting logs: every binary execution recorded, since the set is small and known.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Audit log of secret reads/writes/deletes with client identity and source IP and Policy and auth-method changes; root-token generation events; run `vault audit log --since 24h 2>/dev/null | grep -E '"path":"secret' | head -20` then `vault list sys/policy 2>/dev/null; vault auth list 2>/dev/null`.
3. **Analyze.** Diff the object's ACL before and after: which principal gained which right, and was it granted through nested group membership? Then: Map the attack path the new right enables (e.g., GenericAll on a group -> add self -> Domain Admin) to scope the blast radius.
4. **Contain and harden.** Least-privilege delegation: no GenericAll/WriteDacl outside Domain Admins; regular ACL audits with alerting on changes to protected objects. Asset layer: Short-lived dynamic secrets, no static long-lived tokens, MFA on UI access, sealed storage backend. Environment layer: Data diodes or strictly controlled one-way transfers; media sanitization procedures for anything crossing.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- One-time ACL cleanup without continuous monitoring — delegation sprawl regrows within months.
- Forgetting nested groups: the dangerous ACE is often three group-nestings away from the attacker.
