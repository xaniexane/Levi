# Scheduled Task Persistence Defense for Wireless Controllers in Multi-Cloud (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

Scheduled tasks are the most common Windows persistence: they survive reboots, run as SYSTEM, and hide among thousands of legitimate tasks. Hunt for tasks with odd actions, odd principals, or creation outside change windows. Applies to Wireless Controllers in Multi-Cloud at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- 4698 (scheduled task created) with actions pointing at temp directories, encoded PowerShell, or LOLBins, especially running as SYSTEM.
- Tasks with misleading names mimicking legitimate ones (e.g., 'GoogleUpdateTaskMachineUA' in the wrong path), or tasks created outside maintenance windows.
- Task XML in C:\Windows\System32\Tasks with recent timestamps but no corresponding change record.
- Lens: Best telemetry: client association/auth logs + rogue-AP detection + RADIUS accounting. Cloud-agnostic SIEM normalizing AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Log, and GCP Audit Logs into one schema.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to CSPM coverage across all clouds with consistent misconfiguration alerting.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Client association, authentication (EAP) and roaming logs with device MACs and Rogue AP / evil-twin detections and deauth-flood alerts from WIDS; run `# conceptually (vendor CLIs differ):` then `show wireless client summary | include <suspect-mac>`.
3. **Analyze.** Export the task XML and inspect actions, triggers, principals, and conditions — the full task definition is the evidence. Then: Determine creation vector: who/what created it (user, GPO, remote RPC) to find the still-active access path.
4. **Contain and harden.** Alert on 4698/4702 fleet-wide; restrict task creation rights and audit tasks running as SYSTEM quarterly. Asset layer: WPA3-Enterprise with EAP-TLS (certificates, not PSK); rogue-AP containment enabled. Environment layer: Federated identity across clouds from one IdP; consistent tagging and logging standards per cloud.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Deleting the task but leaving the payload binary — many implants re-create their task on next execution.
- Trusting the task name; always inspect the action path and hash.
