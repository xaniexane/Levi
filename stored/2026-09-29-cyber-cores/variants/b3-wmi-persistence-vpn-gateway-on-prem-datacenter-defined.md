# WMI Persistence Defense for VPN Gateways in On-Premises Datacenter (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

WMI event subscriptions trigger payloads on system events (timers, logons) with no visible scheduled task or service. They are fileless, stealthy, and missed by autorun tools that do not enumerate the WMI repository. Applies to VPN Gateways in On-Premises Datacenter at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- New __EventFilter/__EventConsumer/__FilterToConsumerBinding instances in the WMI repository, especially ActiveScript or CommandLine consumers with encoded commands.
- WmiPrvSE.exe spawning powershell/cmd at odd times, or WMI operational log entries for subscription creation.
- Persistence that survives task/service cleanup — the classic sign the mechanism is WMI-based.
- Lens: Best telemetry: authentication logs + session logs (user, IP, bytes, duration) + gateway patch state. Full network tap/SPAN coverage at core and distribution layers feeding IDS and full-packet capture.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Centralized syslog from all infrastructure with NTP-synced timestamps for cross-device correlation.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in VPN auth logs (success/failure per user with source IPs), session tables with data volumes and Gateway admin audit log and firmware/patch version; client version inventory; run `# conceptually (vendor CLIs differ):` then `show vpn-sessiondb detail anyconnect | grep -E 'Username|Assigned IP|Login Time'`.
3. **Analyze.** Enumerate all event subscriptions (Get-WMIObject -Namespace root\subscription) and inspect each consumer's command line. Then: Correlate subscription creation time with the initial compromise to confirm it is attacker-planted, not admin tooling.
4. **Contain and harden.** Alert on WMI subscription creation events; restrict WMI namespace permissions to administrators. Asset layer: MFA on every VPN profile, device posture checks before granting access, gateway firmware patched urgently. Environment layer: Physical access controls with badge logs correlatable to logical access during investigations.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Declaring a host clean after checking tasks/services/registry but never looking at WMI subscriptions.
- Removing the consumer but leaving the filter and binding, which error silently and get recreated by the implant.
