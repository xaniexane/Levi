# Kubernetes RBAC Abuse Defense for DNS Servers in Azure Cloud (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Overly broad Kubernetes roles let attackers escalate from a compromised pod to cluster admin. RBAC misconfigurations are the Kubernetes equivalent of AD delegation sprawl — audit them the same way. Applies to DNS Servers in Azure Cloud at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- Pods or service accounts using cluster-admin or wildcard roles, especially ones created outside GitOps pipelines.
- Kubernetes audit logs showing service accounts listing secrets cluster-wide or creating privileged pods.
- New ClusterRoleBindings granting powerful roles to default or application service accounts.
- Lens: Best telemetry: query logs (or passive DNS) + zone-transfer/change audit + resolver cache stats. Activity Log and Entra sign-in/audit logs streamed to Log Analytics/SIEM; Defender for Cloud alerts.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NSG flow logs and storage analytics for data-plane visibility.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in DNS query logs showing tunneling/DGA patterns; zone files and their change history and Zone-transfer (AXFR) request logs; DNSSEC validation failure logs; run `grep -E '.{60,}' /var/log/named/query.log | tail -20   # long labels: tunneling/DGA` then `rndc status; echo ---; journalctl -u named --since '1 hour ago' | grep -iE 'transfer|denied|error' | tail -15`.
3. **Analyze.** Map effective permissions per service account: which can read secrets, create pods, or exec into others — that is the blast radius. Then: Check whether the abused binding was created by the attacker or pre-existing misconfiguration.
4. **Contain and harden.** Least-privilege RBAC, no wildcards, no cluster-admin for apps; manage bindings via GitOps with PR review. Asset layer: Restrict recursion to internal clients, block outbound port 53 except resolvers, DNSSEC validation on. Environment layer: Azure Policy deny-effects on risky configurations; PIM-gated subscription roles.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Fixing the abused binding but leaving 50 other wildcard roles in place.
- Forgetting that a compromised pod with cloud credentials can pivot from k8s RBAC to cloud IAM.
