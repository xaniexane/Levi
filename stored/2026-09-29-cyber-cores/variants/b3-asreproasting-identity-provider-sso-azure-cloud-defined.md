# ASREPRoasting Defense for SSO Identity Providers in Azure Cloud (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Accounts with Kerberos pre-authentication disabled can have their AS-REP responses requested by anyone and cracked offline — no authentication needed at all. One misconfigured user account is enough. Applies to SSO Identity Providers in Azure Cloud at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- 4768 (TGT request) events where pre-authentication was not used, from external or unexpected hosts, for accounts flagged DONT_REQ_PREAUTH.
- Enumeration of such accounts (LDAP queries for userAccountControl flags) preceding the roast requests.
- Later logons with the cracked credentials from attacker hosts.
- Lens: Best telemetry: authentication logs with MFA detail + app-assignment changes + federation trust changes. Activity Log and Entra sign-in/audit logs streamed to Log Analytics/SIEM; Defender for Cloud alerts.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NSG flow logs and storage analytics for data-plane visibility.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Authentication logs per application (success/failure, MFA method, device, location) and Application assignment and provisioning logs; new SSO integrations; run `# conceptually (IdP APIs differ):` then `idp-cli logs auth --user <upn> --last 7d --format table | head -25`.
3. **Analyze.** Enumerate all accounts with pre-auth disabled (the full roast-able population) — the fix is one checkbox per account, so find them all. Then: Check whether any of those accounts are privileged or service accounts; prioritize accordingly.
4. **Contain and harden.** Enable Kerberos pre-authentication on every account; audit for the flag regularly — it gets re-disabled by legacy app troubleshooting. Asset layer: Phishing-resistant MFA default, sign-on policies per app risk, session lifetime limits. Environment layer: Azure Policy deny-effects on risky configurations; PIM-gated subscription roles.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Fixing the roasted account but not scanning for the other 40 accounts with the same misconfiguration.
- Assuming pre-auth-disabled accounts are always legacy — verify before re-enabling to avoid breaking production auth.
