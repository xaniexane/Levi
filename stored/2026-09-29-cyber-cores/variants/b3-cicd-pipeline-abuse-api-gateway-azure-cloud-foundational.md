# CI/CD Pipeline Abuse Defense for API Gateways in Azure Cloud (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

Compromised build pipelines inject malicious code into artifacts or exfiltrate secrets from build environments. Pipelines hold production credentials AND ship code — treat them as tier-zero assets. Applies to API Gateways in Azure Cloud at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- Pipeline runs triggered outside normal commits, modified build scripts, or runners executing unexpected network calls.
- Secrets accessed by pipeline jobs that never needed them, or new pipeline variables containing exfil endpoints.
- Artifacts whose hashes differ from reproducible-build expectations.
- Lens: Best telemetry: per-request logs with API key/identity, endpoint, params hash, and response size. Activity Log and Entra sign-in/audit logs streamed to Log Analytics/SIEM; Defender for Cloud alerts.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NSG flow logs and storage analytics for data-plane visibility.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Gateway access logs with authenticated identity per call; rate-limit trigger logs and Schema-validation failure logs (attacks often start as malformed requests); run `grep <api-key-id> /var/log/apigw/access.log | awk '{print $7}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20` then `grep -c 'schema_validation_failed' /var/log/apigw/error.log`.
3. **Analyze.** Diff the pipeline definition against the last known-good version; identify exactly which jobs were tampered with. Then: Determine which secrets the compromised jobs could read and rotate all of them — assume exposure.
4. **Contain and harden.** Pipeline definitions in version control with required reviews; ephemeral, isolated runners; OIDC-based short-lived credentials instead of stored secrets. Asset layer: Positive-security policies: schema validation, per-client rate limits, OAuth scopes per endpoint. Environment layer: Azure Policy deny-effects on risky configurations; PIM-gated subscription roles.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Cleaning the pipeline but shipping artifacts it already poisoned — quarantine recent builds.
- Long-lived cloud credentials stored as pipeline secrets; rotate and replace with OIDC federation.
