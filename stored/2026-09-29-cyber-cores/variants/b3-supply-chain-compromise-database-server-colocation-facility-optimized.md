# Supply Chain Compromise Defense for Database Servers in Colocation Facilities (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Trusted software updates or vendor components carry the attacker's payload — the hardest vector to prevent, because the malware arrives signed and expected. Defense shifts to verification, segmentation, and vendor scrutiny. Applies to Database Servers in Colocation Facilities at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- A signed, trusted application suddenly exhibiting C2 communication or spawning unexpected children after an update.
- Threat intel or vendor advisory naming a specific product version as compromised.
- Anomalous behavior correlated tightly with a software update timestamp across many hosts.
- Lens: Best telemetry: query audit logs (who ran what) + auth logs + backup/restore history. Customer-owned network taps and logging (the colo provider's logs are out of scope — verify contractually).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Badge/physical access logs from the facility correlated with remote-hand ticket times.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Database audit log: logons, privileged statements (DCL/DDL), and bulk-export queries and Slow/general query logs around the incident window; new users, roles, or linked servers; run `-- PostgreSQL style:` then `SELECT usename, query, query_start FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state='active' ORDER BY query_start;`.
3. **Analyze.** Identify the trojanized version and enumerate every host that installed it — the exposure list defines the response scope. Then: Determine what the implanted component could access (its privilege level and data reach) to bound the impact.
4. **Contain and harden.** Software allowlisting with version pinning; staged update rollouts with behavioral monitoring before fleet-wide deploy. Asset layer: Least-privilege DB roles, no app superusers, encrypted connections, auditing on privileged actions. Environment layer: Locked cabinets, private cages, and escort policies for remote hands.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Assuming signed = safe; supply-chain malware is signed by definition.
- Delaying response waiting for the vendor's statement while the implant remains active.
