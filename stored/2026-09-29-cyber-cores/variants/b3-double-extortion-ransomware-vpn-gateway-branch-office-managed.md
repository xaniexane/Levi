# Double-Extortion Ransomware Defense for VPN Gateways in Branch Offices (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Data is exfiltrated BEFORE encryption, so the attacker can leak it even if you restore from backups. The investigation must answer what was stolen, not just what was encrypted — breach notification clocks start on exfiltration. Applies to VPN Gateways in Branch Offices at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- Large outbound transfers (tens of GB) to cloud storage, file shares, or anonymized endpoints in the days before encryption, often via rclone, MEGAsync, or custom tooling.
- Staging directories with archived/renamed sensitive data (databases, file shares zipped) and data-leak-site monitoring hits for your organization name.
- The ransom note references specific stolen files or threatens publication with a countdown timer.
- Lens: Best telemetry: authentication logs + session logs (user, IP, bytes, duration) + gateway patch state. SD-WAN/branch firewall logs forwarded centrally; local DHCP/DNS logs for device attribution.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NAC or port-level logs identifying which device was on which port during the incident.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in VPN auth logs (success/failure per user with source IPs), session tables with data volumes and Gateway admin audit log and firmware/patch version; client version inventory; run `# conceptually (vendor CLIs differ):` then `show vpn-sessiondb detail anyconnect | grep -E 'Username|Assigned IP|Login Time'`.
3. **Analyze.** Quantify the exfil: source directories, file types, record counts, and whether regulated data (PII, PHI, card data) was included — this drives notification obligations. Then: Preserve exfiltration logs (proxy, firewall, DLP, cloud audit) as evidence; they are also the proof of what did and did not leave.
4. **Contain and harden.** DLP egress policies on sensitive data stores plus alerting on bulk archive creation and large outbound transfers. Asset layer: MFA on every VPN profile, device posture checks before granting access, gateway firmware patched urgently. Environment layer: Standardized branch firewall policy deployed as code; no local admin exceptions.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Declaring victory after restoring from backup while stolen data sits on a leak site — the extortion continues.
- Starting the notification clock at encryption time instead of at first confirmed exfiltration.
