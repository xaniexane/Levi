# Firmware Rootkit Defense for Message Queues in Azure Cloud (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Malware in UEFI/BIOS or device firmware survives OS reinstalls and disk replacements. Rare but devastating — detection needs firmware measurement (TPM attestation) and dedicated scanning, not standard AV. Applies to Message Queues in Azure Cloud at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- CHIPSEC or firmware-scanner findings of modified UEFI modules, unexpected DXE drivers, or Secure Boot disabled without authorization.
- TPM attestation failures or PCR values deviating from the known-good baseline for the hardware model.
- Persistence surviving full disk wipe and OS reinstall — the hallmark symptom.
- Lens: Best telemetry: queue depth/lag metrics + producer/consumer auth logs + dead-letter queues. Activity Log and Entra sign-in/audit logs streamed to Log Analytics/SIEM; Defender for Cloud alerts.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NSG flow logs and storage analytics for data-plane visibility.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Queue metrics: depth spikes, consumer lag, and poison-message dead-letter queues and Authentication logs for producers/consumers; new queue/topic creation events; run `rabbitmqctl list_queues name messages consumers 2>/dev/null | head -20` then `kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server <broker> --describe --all-groups 2>/dev/null | head -20`.
3. **Analyze.** Dump the firmware image (with authorization) and diff against the vendor's known-good image for the exact board and version. Then: Determine the implant's capabilities: network, persistence mechanism, and whether it targets other hosts (some spread via firmware update mechanisms).
4. **Contain and harden.** Enable Secure Boot + TPM measured boot fleet-wide; lock BIOS with admin passwords and signed firmware updates only. Asset layer: Authentication on all clients, TLS in transit, authorization per queue/topic, quotas on producers. Environment layer: Azure Policy deny-effects on risky configurations; PIM-gated subscription roles.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Reinstalling the OS repeatedly while the firmware implant re-infects each build.
- Running firmware scans from the potentially compromised OS — use offline/BIOS-level tooling.
