# Log Tampering Defense for GCP Projects in Hybrid Cloud (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers clear or alter logs to blind defenders — event log clears, audit policy disabling, or timestomping. The tampering itself is evidence: treat cleared logs as confirmation of malicious activity, not as missing data. Applies to GCP Projects in Hybrid Cloud at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- Event 1102 (audit log cleared) or 104 (log cleared), audit policy changes disabling categories, or gaps in otherwise continuous log streams.
- Timestomped files (MFT timestamps inconsistent with sequence numbers) or syslog gaps from specific hosts.
- SIEM agent uninstalls or forwarding configuration changes.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Cloud Audit Logs (Admin Activity + Data Access) + Security Command Center + VPC flow logs. Unified SIEM ingesting both on-prem syslog and cloud audit trails with identity correlation across both.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Conditional-access and network logs covering the interconnect (ExpressRoute/Direct Connect/VPN).

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Cloud Audit Logs: setIamPolicy, storage.setIamPermissions, compute inserts, and console logons and Security Command Center findings; Forseti/Config Validator drift reports where deployed; run `gcloud logging read 'protoPayload.methodName:"SetIamPolicy"' --limit 20 --format='table(timestamp, protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail, resourceName)'` then `gcloud scc findings list organizations/$ORG_ID --filter='state="ACTIVE"' --limit 15`.
3. **Analyze.** The clear event's timestamp bounds the attacker's active window — focus forensic effort just before it. Then: Recover from redundant sources: EDR cloud telemetry, network logs, and central syslog often survive local clears.
4. **Contain and harden.** Forward logs off-host in real time to tamper-evident central storage; alert on 1102/104 immediately. Asset layer: Organization policies: no public buckets, no default SA use, OS Login on; deny unapproved APIs. Environment layer: Consistent identity (single IdP) across on-prem and cloud; no parallel credential stores.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Treating 'no logs' as 'no evidence of compromise' — absence after tampering IS the evidence.
- Relying solely on host logs; always have an independent telemetry path (network, EDR cloud).
