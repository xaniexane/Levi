# Insider Data Theft Defense for Email Gateways in GCP Cloud (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

A trusted user steals data — often before resignation. Unlike external attacks there is no malware to find; detection relies on behavioral baselines: access volume, off-hours activity, and personal-storage uploads. Handle with HR and legal from the start. Applies to Email Gateways in GCP Cloud at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- A user accessing far more files or records than their role baseline, especially in the 30 days before resignation or termination.
- Bulk downloads to USB, personal cloud uploads, or emailing attachments to personal addresses from a corporate account.
- Off-hours access to repositories the user never touched before, or permission changes granting themselves broader access.
- Lens: Best telemetry: message-tracking logs + sandbox verdicts + URL-rewrite click logs. Cloud Audit Logs (admin + data access) exported to a locked-down logging project.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Security Command Center findings and VPC flow logs centralized.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Message tracking (sender, recipients, subject hash, attachments, verdicts) for the campaign window and Sandbox detonation reports for attachments/URLs; quarantined message copies; run `# conceptually (gateway CLIs differ):` then `message-tracking --sender <suspect-domain> --last 7d`.
3. **Analyze.** Build a 90-day access timeline for the user: volume, data sensitivity, destination (USB serial, cloud account, personal email) — coordinate collection with HR/legal to stay compliant. Then: Determine business justification for each anomaly with the user's manager before concluding malice; over-collection without cause creates liability.
4. **Contain and harden.** UEBA baselines with alerting on pre-resignation access spikes; disable USB mass storage or enforce encryption + logging. Asset layer: Sandbox detonation for all attachments/links, DMARC p=reject on owned domains, banner external mail. Environment layer: Organization policies constraining public exposure, API enablement, and service-account key creation.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Investigating without HR/legal involvement — privacy and employment law exposure is real.
- Confronting the user before evidence is preserved; they will delete local copies first.
