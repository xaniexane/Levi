# Kubernetes RBAC Abuse Defense for SIEM Platforms in Colocation Facilities (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

Overly broad Kubernetes roles let attackers escalate from a compromised pod to cluster admin. RBAC misconfigurations are the Kubernetes equivalent of AD delegation sprawl — audit them the same way. Applies to SIEM Platforms in Colocation Facilities at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- Pods or service accounts using cluster-admin or wildcard roles, especially ones created outside GitOps pipelines.
- Kubernetes audit logs showing service accounts listing secrets cluster-wide or creating privileged pods.
- New ClusterRoleBindings granting powerful roles to default or application service accounts.
- Lens: Best telemetry: ingestion health metrics + rule-hit history + analyst audit trail. Customer-owned network taps and logging (the colo provider's logs are out of scope — verify contractually).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Badge/physical access logs from the facility correlated with remote-hand ticket times.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Detection rule hit history for the incident's indicators across the full retention window and Ingestion gap reports: which sources stopped logging and when (coverage blind spots); run `# conceptually (SIEM query languages differ):` then `index=* <indicator> earliest=-30d | stats count by sourcetype`.
3. **Analyze.** Map effective permissions per service account: which can read secrets, create pods, or exec into others — that is the blast radius. Then: Check whether the abused binding was created by the attacker or pre-existing misconfiguration.
4. **Contain and harden.** Least-privilege RBAC, no wildcards, no cluster-admin for apps; manage bindings via GitOps with PR review. Asset layer: Separate SIEM admin credentials, tamper-evident storage, monitored ingestion pipelines. Environment layer: Locked cabinets, private cages, and escort policies for remote hands.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Fixing the abused binding but leaving 50 other wildcard roles in place.
- Forgetting that a compromised pod with cloud credentials can pivot from k8s RBAC to cloud IAM.
