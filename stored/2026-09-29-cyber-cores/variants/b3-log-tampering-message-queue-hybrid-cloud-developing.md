# Log Tampering Defense for Message Queues in Hybrid Cloud (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers clear or alter logs to blind defenders — event log clears, audit policy disabling, or timestomping. The tampering itself is evidence: treat cleared logs as confirmation of malicious activity, not as missing data. Applies to Message Queues in Hybrid Cloud at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- Event 1102 (audit log cleared) or 104 (log cleared), audit policy changes disabling categories, or gaps in otherwise continuous log streams.
- Timestomped files (MFT timestamps inconsistent with sequence numbers) or syslog gaps from specific hosts.
- SIEM agent uninstalls or forwarding configuration changes.
- Lens: Best telemetry: queue depth/lag metrics + producer/consumer auth logs + dead-letter queues. Unified SIEM ingesting both on-prem syslog and cloud audit trails with identity correlation across both.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Conditional-access and network logs covering the interconnect (ExpressRoute/Direct Connect/VPN).

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Queue metrics: depth spikes, consumer lag, and poison-message dead-letter queues and Authentication logs for producers/consumers; new queue/topic creation events; run `rabbitmqctl list_queues name messages consumers 2>/dev/null | head -20` then `kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server <broker> --describe --all-groups 2>/dev/null | head -20`.
3. **Analyze.** The clear event's timestamp bounds the attacker's active window — focus forensic effort just before it. Then: Recover from redundant sources: EDR cloud telemetry, network logs, and central syslog often survive local clears.
4. **Contain and harden.** Forward logs off-host in real time to tamper-evident central storage; alert on 1102/104 immediately. Asset layer: Authentication on all clients, TLS in transit, authorization per queue/topic, quotas on producers. Environment layer: Consistent identity (single IdP) across on-prem and cloud; no parallel credential stores.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Treating 'no logs' as 'no evidence of compromise' — absence after tampering IS the evidence.
- Relying solely on host logs; always have an independent telemetry path (network, EDR cloud).
