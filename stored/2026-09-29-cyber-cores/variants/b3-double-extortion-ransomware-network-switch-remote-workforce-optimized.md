# Double-Extortion Ransomware Defense for Network Switches in Remote Workforce (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Data is exfiltrated BEFORE encryption, so the attacker can leak it even if you restore from backups. The investigation must answer what was stolen, not just what was encrypted — breach notification clocks start on exfiltration. Applies to Network Switches in Remote Workforce at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- Large outbound transfers (tens of GB) to cloud storage, file shares, or anonymized endpoints in the days before encryption, often via rclone, MEGAsync, or custom tooling.
- Staging directories with archived/renamed sensitive data (databases, file shares zipped) and data-leak-site monitoring hits for your organization name.
- The ransom note references specific stolen files or threatens publication with a countdown timer.
- Lens: Best telemetry: syslog (port up/down, STP changes, config changes) + SNMP/NetFlow + NAC logs. EDR on every endpoint as the primary sensor (no corporate network tap for remote hosts).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to VPN/ZTNA access logs and SaaS/IdP sign-in logs as the network-visibility substitute.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Syslog: link-state changes, MAC flaps, STP topology changes, login attempts and MAC address tables and ARP tables for device-to-port mapping during incidents; run `show mac address-table | include <suspect-mac>` then `show logging | include %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP|%PORT_SECURITY`.
3. **Analyze.** Quantify the exfil: source directories, file types, record counts, and whether regulated data (PII, PHI, card data) was included — this drives notification obligations. Then: Preserve exfiltration logs (proxy, firewall, DLP, cloud audit) as evidence; they are also the proof of what did and did not leave.
4. **Contain and harden.** DLP egress policies on sensitive data stores plus alerting on bulk archive creation and large outbound transfers. Asset layer: Port security / 802.1X on access ports, BPDU guard, DHCP snooping + dynamic ARP inspection. Environment layer: Zero-trust access: device compliance + MFA per application, not per network.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Declaring victory after restoring from backup while stolen data sits on a leak site — the extortion continues.
- Starting the notification clock at encryption time instead of at first confirmed exfiltration.
