# Windows Privilege Escalation Defense for SIEM Platforms in Remote Workforce (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

From standard user to SYSTEM/Administrator via unquoted service paths, writable service binaries, AlwaysInstallElevated, token manipulation, or kernel exploits. Windows privesc is usually a misconfiguration the attacker read, not a zero-day they brought. Applies to SIEM Platforms in Remote Workforce at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- Service creation or modification events (7045/4697) pointing at user-writable paths, or processes spawning as SYSTEM from unexpected parents.
- Registry writes to AlwaysInstallElevated keys, accessibility binary replacement (sethc/utilman), or token duplication API patterns in EDR telemetry.
- Enumeration tooling: whoami /priv, accesschk, or PowerShell privesc scripts running before the escalation.
- Lens: Best telemetry: ingestion health metrics + rule-hit history + analyst audit trail. EDR on every endpoint as the primary sensor (no corporate network tap for remote hosts).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to VPN/ZTNA access logs and SaaS/IdP sign-in logs as the network-visibility substitute.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Detection rule hit history for the incident's indicators across the full retention window and Ingestion gap reports: which sources stopped logging and when (coverage blind spots); run `# conceptually (SIEM query languages differ):` then `index=* <indicator> earliest=-30d | stats count by sourcetype`.
3. **Analyze.** Pin down the primitive: unquoted path, weak service ACL, scheduled task with stored creds, or kernel CVE — then check how many fleet hosts share it. Then: Review what the elevated access touched: SAM/LSASS access after escalation means credential theft followed.
4. **Contain and harden.** Fix service ACLs and paths fleet-wide, disable AlwaysInstallElevated, and enforce signed-driver and LSA protection policies. Asset layer: Separate SIEM admin credentials, tamper-evident storage, monitored ingestion pipelines. Environment layer: Zero-trust access: device compliance + MFA per application, not per network.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Reimaging one host while the GPO-deployed misconfiguration recreates the hole on every rebuild.
- Missing that the attacker already dumped credentials post-escalation — scope the follow-on theft, not just the privesc.
