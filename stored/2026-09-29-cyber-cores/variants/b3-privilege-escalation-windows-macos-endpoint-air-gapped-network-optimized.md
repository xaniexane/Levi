# Windows Privilege Escalation Defense for macOS Endpoints in Air-Gapped Networks (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

From standard user to SYSTEM/Administrator via unquoted service paths, writable service binaries, AlwaysInstallElevated, token manipulation, or kernel exploits. Windows privesc is usually a misconfiguration the attacker read, not a zero-day they brought. Applies to macOS Endpoints in Air-Gapped Networks at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- Service creation or modification events (7045/4697) pointing at user-writable paths, or processes spawning as SYSTEM from unexpected parents.
- Registry writes to AlwaysInstallElevated keys, accessibility binary replacement (sethc/utilman), or token duplication API patterns in EDR telemetry.
- Enumeration tooling: whoami /priv, accesschk, or PowerShell privesc scripts running before the escalation.
- Lens: Best telemetry: unified log + EDR agent + Santa/Munki logs where deployed. Local SIEM/log collector inside the enclave (no cloud shipping); removable-media transfer logs.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Strict allowlisting logs: every binary execution recorded, since the set is small and known.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Unified log (log show) for process execution and auth events; login items and LaunchAgents/LaunchDaemons plists and Quarantine attributes (xattr com.apple.quarantine) on downloads; Gatekeeper assessment history; run `log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "sshd"' --last 2h | tail -20` then `ls -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ /Library/LaunchDaemons/ /Library/LaunchAgents/ 2>/dev/null`.
3. **Analyze.** Pin down the primitive: unquoted path, weak service ACL, scheduled task with stored creds, or kernel CVE — then check how many fleet hosts share it. Then: Review what the elevated access touched: SAM/LSASS access after escalation means credential theft followed.
4. **Contain and harden.** Fix service ACLs and paths fleet-wide, disable AlwaysInstallElevated, and enforce signed-driver and LSA protection policies. Asset layer: Gatekeeper + XProtect current, FileVault on, firewall on, and MDM-enforced configuration profiles. Environment layer: Data diodes or strictly controlled one-way transfers; media sanitization procedures for anything crossing.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Reimaging one host while the GPO-deployed misconfiguration recreates the hole on every rebuild.
- Missing that the attacker already dumped credentials post-escalation — scope the follow-on theft, not just the privesc.
