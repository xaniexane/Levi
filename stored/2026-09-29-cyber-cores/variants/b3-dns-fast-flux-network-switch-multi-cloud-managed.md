# DNS Fast-Flux Defense for Network Switches in Multi-Cloud (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Fast-flux networks rotate DNS answers across many compromised hosts every few minutes, making malicious infrastructure hard to takedown. Defenders detect the flux pattern itself: low TTLs, high answer churn, and geographically scattered A records. Applies to Network Switches in Multi-Cloud at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- DNS answers with TTLs under 300 seconds rotating across dozens of IPs in unrelated ASNs and countries for a single domain.
- Short-lived domains (registered days ago) resolving to residential or compromised-server IPs with no legitimate business relationship.
- Endpoint connections to flux domains correlating with malware detonations or phishing kit infrastructure.
- Lens: Best telemetry: syslog (port up/down, STP changes, config changes) + SNMP/NetFlow + NAC logs. Cloud-agnostic SIEM normalizing AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Log, and GCP Audit Logs into one schema.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to CSPM coverage across all clouds with consistent misconfiguration alerting.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Syslog: link-state changes, MAC flaps, STP topology changes, login attempts and MAC address tables and ARP tables for device-to-port mapping during incidents; run `show mac address-table | include <suspect-mac>` then `show logging | include %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP|%PORT_SECURITY`.
3. **Analyze.** Profile the flux: record TTL, unique IPs per hour, ASN/country spread, and name-server patterns to fingerprint the specific flux service or kit. Then: Pivot from the domain to find sibling infrastructure: shared name servers, registration patterns, and certificate overlaps.
4. **Contain and harden.** DNS response policy zones (RPZ) blocking confirmed flux domains, plus alerting on sub-300s TTL answers at the resolver. Asset layer: Port security / 802.1X on access ports, BPDU guard, DHCP snooping + dynamic ARP inspection. Environment layer: Federated identity across clouds from one IdP; consistent tagging and logging standards per cloud.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Blocking individual flux IPs — they churn in minutes; block the domain pattern and the detection logic instead.
- Confusing legitimate CDN behavior (low TTL, many IPs) with flux; require the ASN-scatter plus short-domain-age combination.
