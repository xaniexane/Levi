# Password Spraying Defense for Database Servers in On-Premises Datacenter (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers try a small set of common passwords against many usernames, staying under per-account lockout thresholds. It is quieter than stuffing and specifically tuned to evade lockout policies, often running for days or weeks. Applies to Database Servers in On-Premises Datacenter at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- A handful of failed logons per account (1-3) spread across hundreds of accounts from one or a few IPs, repeating on a schedule — the classic low-and-slow pattern.
- The same few passwords attempted everywhere (SeasonYear!, Company123, Password1); check by aggregating failed-logon password hashes where your IdP logs them.
- Spray bursts correlated with newly published password lists or timed to holidays/weekends when response is slower.
- Lens: Best telemetry: query audit logs (who ran what) + auth logs + backup/restore history. Full network tap/SPAN coverage at core and distribution layers feeding IDS and full-packet capture.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Centralized syslog from all infrastructure with NTP-synced timestamps for cross-device correlation.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Database audit log: logons, privileged statements (DCL/DDL), and bulk-export queries and Slow/general query logs around the incident window; new users, roles, or linked servers; run `-- PostgreSQL style:` then `SELECT usename, query, query_start FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state='active' ORDER BY query_start;`.
3. **Analyze.** Reconstruct the spray window: first-seen to last-seen per source IP, and list every account with even one success inside the window — those are confirmed or suspected takeovers. Then: Check whether sprayed accounts share traits (same OU, same onboarding batch, service accounts) to find how the username list was built.
4. **Contain and harden.** Smart lockout (soft lockout with increasing delays) plus alerting on distributed low-volume failures, not just lockouts. Asset layer: Least-privilege DB roles, no app superusers, encrypted connections, auditing on privileged actions. Environment layer: Physical access controls with badge logs correlatable to logical access during investigations.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Per-account lockout thresholds alone will not catch spraying; you need cross-account velocity detection.
- Treating one success as an isolated incident misses the campaign — always scope the full spray window.
