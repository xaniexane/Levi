# DLL Hijacking Defense for AWS Accounts in Remote Workforce (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Applications loading DLLs from insecure paths let attackers plant a malicious DLL that executes with the application's privileges. Detection focuses on DLL loads from writable directories and known-vulnerable applications. Applies to AWS Accounts in Remote Workforce at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- Sysmon event 7 (image loaded) showing DLLs loaded from temp, downloads, or user-writable directories by privileged processes.
- New DLL files appearing alongside application executables, especially with names matching system DLLs.
- Application crashes or behavior changes after a DLL appears in its directory.
- Lens: Best telemetry: CloudTrail (org trail, all regions) + GuardDuty + VPC flow logs + Config. EDR on every endpoint as the primary sensor (no corporate network tap for remote hosts).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to VPN/ZTNA access logs and SaaS/IdP sign-in logs as the network-visibility substitute.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in CloudTrail event history (console logons, IAM changes, AssumeRole, security-group changes) and GuardDuty findings, IAM Access Analyzer results, and S3 server-access logs for data stores; run `aws cloudtrail lookup-events --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=EventName,AttributeValue=ConsoleLogin --max-items 20` then `aws iam generate-credential-report && aws iam get-credential-report --query Content --output text | base64 -d | head -5`.
3. **Analyze.** Verify the loading order: confirm the planted DLL shadows a legitimate one via PATH or application-directory precedence. Then: Check the DLL's exports and behavior in a sandbox — many hijack DLLs proxy the original to stay stealthy.
4. **Contain and harden.** Applications should use absolute paths and SafeDllSearchMode; remove user-writable directories from the DLL search order. Asset layer: MFA on root + all IAM users, SCPs denying logging disablement and unapproved regions, no long-lived keys. Environment layer: Zero-trust access: device compliance + MFA per application, not per network.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Deleting the DLL without fixing the insecure load order — the hole remains for the next attacker.
- Assuming signed applications are immune; the signature covers the EXE, not the DLL it loads.
