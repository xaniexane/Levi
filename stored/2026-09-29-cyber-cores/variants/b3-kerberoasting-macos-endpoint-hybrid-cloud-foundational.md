# Kerberoasting Defense for macOS Endpoints in Hybrid Cloud (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers request service tickets for SPN accounts and crack them offline to recover service-account passwords — no alerts on the DC, because requesting tickets is normal. The defense is making those passwords uncrackable and the requests visible. Applies to macOS Endpoints in Hybrid Cloud at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- A single account requesting an unusual number of service tickets (4769) with RC4 encryption for many different SPNs in a short window.
- Ticket requests for SPNs from accounts with no business need, or requests at odd hours from a workstation (not a server).
- Subsequent use of a cracked service account: logons from unexpected hosts or privilege changes for that account.
- Lens: Best telemetry: unified log + EDR agent + Santa/Munki logs where deployed. Unified SIEM ingesting both on-prem syslog and cloud audit trails with identity correlation across both.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Conditional-access and network logs covering the interconnect (ExpressRoute/Direct Connect/VPN).

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Unified log (log show) for process execution and auth events; login items and LaunchAgents/LaunchDaemons plists and Quarantine attributes (xattr com.apple.quarantine) on downloads; Gatekeeper assessment history; run `log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "sshd"' --last 2h | tail -20` then `ls -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ /Library/LaunchDaemons/ /Library/LaunchAgents/ 2>/dev/null`.
3. **Analyze.** List every SPN targeted and assess the crackability of each service account's password (length, complexity, age). Then: If a service account was cracked, treat it as full compromise: inventory everything that account could touch.
4. **Contain and harden.** Service accounts: 25+ character random passwords, or better, group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) with automatic rotation. Asset layer: Gatekeeper + XProtect current, FileVault on, firewall on, and MDM-enforced configuration profiles. Environment layer: Consistent identity (single IdP) across on-prem and cloud; no parallel credential stores.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Rotating the password but leaving the SPN on a weak account — the attacker just roasts it again.
- Missing that the cracked service account may have been used to request MORE tickets (roast chaining).
