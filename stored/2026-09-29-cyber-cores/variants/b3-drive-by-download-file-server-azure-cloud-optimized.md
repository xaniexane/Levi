# Drive-By Download Defense for File Servers in Azure Cloud (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Visiting a compromised or malicious page silently downloads malware via browser or plugin exploits. Patching and browser isolation remove the opportunity; proxy logs reveal the exposure. Applies to File Servers in Azure Cloud at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- Browser spawning unexpected child processes or writing executables to temp/downloads without user download action.
- Proxy logs showing visits to compromised sites followed by executable downloads, often via redirect chains.
- Exploit-kit patterns: rapid plugin version probing, obfuscated JavaScript, then payload fetch.
- Lens: Best telemetry: object-access auditing (who opened/modified what) + share-permission reviews. Activity Log and Entra sign-in/audit logs streamed to Log Analytics/SIEM; Defender for Cloud alerts.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NSG flow logs and storage analytics for data-plane visibility.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in File-access audit events (4663/4656 on Windows; auditd on Linux) for sensitive shares and Share and NTFS/ACL permission exports; recent permission-change events; run `Get-SmbShare | Select-Object Name, Path, Description; echo ---; Get-SmbShareAccess -Name <share>` then `Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; Id=4663} -MaxEvents 100 | Group-Object {$_.Properties[1].Value} | Sort-Object Count -Descending | Select-Object -First 10 Name, Count`.
3. **Analyze.** Reconstruct the redirect chain from proxy logs to identify the compromised page or malvertising source. Then: Determine whether the payload executed: browser process tree and EDR execution events after the download timestamp.
4. **Contain and harden.** Automatic browser and OS patching; remove or sandbox legacy plugins (Java, Flash-era); consider browser isolation for high-risk users. Asset layer: Access-based enumeration, least-privilege share/NTFS rights, no Everyone:Full Control anywhere. Environment layer: Azure Policy deny-effects on risky configurations; PIM-gated subscription roles.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Assuming the user 'must have clicked something' — drive-bys need no click, so user interviews mislead.
- Cleaning the endpoint without blocking the compromised site that will re-infect the next visitor.
