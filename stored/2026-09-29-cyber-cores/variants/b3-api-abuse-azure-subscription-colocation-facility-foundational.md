# Public API Abuse Defense for Azure Subscriptions in Colocation Facilities (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

Exposed APIs are probed for injection, broken auth, and excessive data exposure. API abuse looks like legitimate traffic at volume — detection needs API-aware logging (endpoint, parameters, auth context), not just web logs. Applies to Azure Subscriptions in Colocation Facilities at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- High-rate 4xx/5xx sequences against API endpoints indicating fuzzing, or single clients enumerating object IDs sequentially.
- Authenticated API calls accessing other users' objects (BOLA/IDOR patterns) or returning bulk data far beyond normal use.
- Known attack strings (SQLi, SSTI payloads) in API parameters.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Activity Log + Entra sign-in logs + Defender for Cloud + NSG flow logs. Customer-owned network taps and logging (the colo provider's logs are out of scope — verify contractually).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Badge/physical access logs from the facility correlated with remote-hand ticket times.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Azure Activity Log (write/delete on IAM, policy, network) and Entra audit/sign-in logs and Defender for Cloud recommendations and alerts; resource-change history; run `az monitor activity-log list --max-events 25 --query '[].{time:eventTimestamp, op:operationName.value, caller:caller}' -o table` then `az security alert list --query '[].{name:alertDisplayName, severity:severity, time:timeGeneratedUtc}' -o table`.
3. **Analyze.** Replay the suspect API sessions to determine exactly which records were accessed — the breach scope is the data returned, not the requests made. Then: Check whether the abused endpoint lacks authorization checks versus a credentialed attacker using stolen tokens.
4. **Contain and harden.** Positive-security API gateway policies: schema validation, rate limits per client, and authorization checks on every object reference. Asset layer: Azure Policy deny-effects on public storage/exposure; PIM for subscription roles; Defender plans on. Environment layer: Locked cabinets, private cages, and escort policies for remote hands.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- WAF-only defense: most API abuse is semantically valid HTTP that no signature catches.
- Logging without the auth context — you cannot distinguish attack from customer without knowing WHO called.
