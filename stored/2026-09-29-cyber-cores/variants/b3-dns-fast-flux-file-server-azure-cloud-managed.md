# DNS Fast-Flux Defense for File Servers in Azure Cloud (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Fast-flux networks rotate DNS answers across many compromised hosts every few minutes, making malicious infrastructure hard to takedown. Defenders detect the flux pattern itself: low TTLs, high answer churn, and geographically scattered A records. Applies to File Servers in Azure Cloud at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- DNS answers with TTLs under 300 seconds rotating across dozens of IPs in unrelated ASNs and countries for a single domain.
- Short-lived domains (registered days ago) resolving to residential or compromised-server IPs with no legitimate business relationship.
- Endpoint connections to flux domains correlating with malware detonations or phishing kit infrastructure.
- Lens: Best telemetry: object-access auditing (who opened/modified what) + share-permission reviews. Activity Log and Entra sign-in/audit logs streamed to Log Analytics/SIEM; Defender for Cloud alerts.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NSG flow logs and storage analytics for data-plane visibility.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in File-access audit events (4663/4656 on Windows; auditd on Linux) for sensitive shares and Share and NTFS/ACL permission exports; recent permission-change events; run `Get-SmbShare | Select-Object Name, Path, Description; echo ---; Get-SmbShareAccess -Name <share>` then `Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; Id=4663} -MaxEvents 100 | Group-Object {$_.Properties[1].Value} | Sort-Object Count -Descending | Select-Object -First 10 Name, Count`.
3. **Analyze.** Profile the flux: record TTL, unique IPs per hour, ASN/country spread, and name-server patterns to fingerprint the specific flux service or kit. Then: Pivot from the domain to find sibling infrastructure: shared name servers, registration patterns, and certificate overlaps.
4. **Contain and harden.** DNS response policy zones (RPZ) blocking confirmed flux domains, plus alerting on sub-300s TTL answers at the resolver. Asset layer: Access-based enumeration, least-privilege share/NTFS rights, no Everyone:Full Control anywhere. Environment layer: Azure Policy deny-effects on risky configurations; PIM-gated subscription roles.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Blocking individual flux IPs — they churn in minutes; block the domain pattern and the detection logic instead.
- Confusing legitimate CDN behavior (low TTL, many IPs) with flux; require the ASN-scatter plus short-domain-age combination.
