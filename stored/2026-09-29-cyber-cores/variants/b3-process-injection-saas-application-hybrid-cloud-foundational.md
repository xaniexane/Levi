# Process Injection Defense for SaaS Applications in Hybrid Cloud (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

Malware hides inside legitimate processes via injection (CreateRemoteThread, APC, process hollowing), blending with normal activity. Memory-focused detection — EDR telemetry and targeted memory analysis — is the answer; disk forensics alone misses it. Applies to SaaS Applications in Hybrid Cloud at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- EDR alerts on cross-process memory writes (CreateRemoteThread, NtQueueApcThread) from unusual sources, or hollowed processes (image path mismatches the in-memory PE).
- Legitimate processes (explorer, svchost) making unexpected network connections or spawning children they never normally do.
- Sysmon event 8 (CreateRemoteThread) and event 10 (ProcessAccess) with suspicious granted-access masks.
- Lens: Best telemetry: SaaS audit logs (admin + user activity) streamed to SIEM + SSO logs. Unified SIEM ingesting both on-prem syslog and cloud audit trails with identity correlation across both.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Conditional-access and network logs covering the interconnect (ExpressRoute/Direct Connect/VPN).

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Admin audit log (settings changes, user provisioning, sharing changes) and User activity logs: file access, downloads, external sharing events; run `# conceptually (SaaS APIs differ):` then `saas-cli audit log --category admin --last 7d --format table | head -25`.
3. **Analyze.** Capture process memory before killing anything; extract the injected payload for family identification. Then: Trace the injector: which process performed the injection and how did IT get compromised (the delivery chain).
4. **Contain and harden.** EDR with behavioral blocking on injection primitives; application control to prevent the initial injector from running. Asset layer: SSO with MFA enforced, SCIM provisioning, least-privilege roles, external-sharing restricted. Environment layer: Consistent identity (single IdP) across on-prem and cloud; no parallel credential stores.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Killing the host process without capturing memory — the payload exists only in RAM and the evidence is gone.
- Whitelisting the injected process because its NAME is legitimate; verify the in-memory image, not the filename.
