# Supply Chain Compromise Defense for Load Balancers in On-Premises Datacenter (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Trusted software updates or vendor components carry the attacker's payload — the hardest vector to prevent, because the malware arrives signed and expected. Defense shifts to verification, segmentation, and vendor scrutiny. Applies to Load Balancers in On-Premises Datacenter at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- A signed, trusted application suddenly exhibiting C2 communication or spawning unexpected children after an update.
- Threat intel or vendor advisory naming a specific product version as compromised.
- Anomalous behavior correlated tightly with a software update timestamp across many hosts.
- Lens: Best telemetry: access logs with X-Forwarded-For + backend health flaps + config-change audit. Full network tap/SPAN coverage at core and distribution layers feeding IDS and full-packet capture.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Centralized syslog from all infrastructure with NTP-synced timestamps for cross-device correlation.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Access logs (client IP, Host header, URI, status, bytes) — the edge view of web attacks and Backend pool changes and health-check failure histories; run `grep -E ' 4[0-9]{2} ' /var/log/haproxy.log | awk '{print $6}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -15` then `echo 'show stat' | socat unix-connect:/var/run/haproxy.sock stdio 2>/dev/null | cut -d, -f1,2,18 | head -20`.
3. **Analyze.** Identify the trojanized version and enumerate every host that installed it — the exposure list defines the response scope. Then: Determine what the implanted component could access (its privilege level and data reach) to bound the impact.
4. **Contain and harden.** Software allowlisting with version pinning; staged update rollouts with behavioral monitoring before fleet-wide deploy. Asset layer: TLS 1.2+ with strong ciphers, HSTS, WAF integration at the edge, config changes via version control. Environment layer: Physical access controls with badge logs correlatable to logical access during investigations.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Assuming signed = safe; supply-chain malware is signed by definition.
- Delaying response waiting for the vendor's statement while the implant remains active.
