# Golden Ticket Attack Defense for GCP Projects in Branch Offices (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Forged Kerberos TGTs using the stolen krbtgt hash grant unrestricted, long-lived domain access that survives password resets. Detection relies on ticket anomalies: impossible lifetimes, wrong encryption, or logons that bypass the DC. Applies to GCP Projects in Branch Offices at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- TGTs with lifetimes far exceeding domain policy (e.g., 10 years), RC4-encrypted tickets in an AES-enforced domain, or tickets for accounts that never authenticated (no 4768).
- 4769 service-ticket requests referencing a TGT the DC never issued, or logons from hosts with no corresponding interactive session.
- The krbtgt account's own anomalous activity following a DCSync event.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Cloud Audit Logs (Admin Activity + Data Access) + Security Command Center + VPC flow logs. SD-WAN/branch firewall logs forwarded centrally; local DHCP/DNS logs for device attribution.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NAC or port-level logs identifying which device was on which port during the incident.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Cloud Audit Logs: setIamPolicy, storage.setIamPermissions, compute inserts, and console logons and Security Command Center findings; Forseti/Config Validator drift reports where deployed; run `gcloud logging read 'protoPayload.methodName:"SetIamPolicy"' --limit 20 --format='table(timestamp, protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail, resourceName)'` then `gcloud scc findings list organizations/$ORG_ID --filter='state="ACTIVE"' --limit 15`.
3. **Analyze.** Confirm via ticket inspection (klist, network capture): lifetime, encryption type, and client name mismatches prove forgery. Then: Scope everything done under forged tickets — assume full domain compromise until proven otherwise.
4. **Contain and harden.** Rotate the krbtgt password TWICE (to invalidate both current and previous hash) after any suspected compromise. Asset layer: Organization policies: no public buckets, no default SA use, OS Login on; deny unapproved APIs. Environment layer: Standardized branch firewall policy deployed as code; no local admin exceptions.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Rotating krbtgt only once — the N-1 hash remains valid and the golden ticket still works.
- Treating it as an account incident instead of a domain-trust incident; the response scope is the whole forest.
