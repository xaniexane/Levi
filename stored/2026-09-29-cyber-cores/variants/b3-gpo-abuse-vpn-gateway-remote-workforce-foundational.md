# Group Policy Abuse Defense for VPN Gateways in Remote Workforce (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

Group Policy deploys to every machine in scope — including attacker-planted scheduled tasks, scripts, and software. A malicious GPO is a domain-wide persistence and execution platform; monitor GPO changes like code deployments. Applies to VPN Gateways in Remote Workforce at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- 5136/5137 directory-service changes creating or modifying GPOs, especially new immediate scheduled tasks, startup scripts, or software installation policies.
- SYSVOL replication of unexpected scripts/executables, or GPO version number jumps without a change ticket.
- Mass host behavior change correlating with GP refresh cycles (new persistence appearing fleet-wide simultaneously).
- Lens: Best telemetry: authentication logs + session logs (user, IP, bytes, duration) + gateway patch state. EDR on every endpoint as the primary sensor (no corporate network tap for remote hosts).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to VPN/ZTNA access logs and SaaS/IdP sign-in logs as the network-visibility substitute.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in VPN auth logs (success/failure per user with source IPs), session tables with data volumes and Gateway admin audit log and firmware/patch version; client version inventory; run `# conceptually (vendor CLIs differ):` then `show vpn-sessiondb detail anyconnect | grep -E 'Username|Assigned IP|Login Time'`.
3. **Analyze.** Inspect the GPO's full settings and linked scripts; determine the deployment scope (which OUs) to size the affected fleet. Then: Check GPO backup/version history to find when the malicious change was introduced and by whom.
4. **Contain and harden.** Restrict GPO edit rights to a break-glass group, require change tickets, and alert on any GPO modification in real time. Asset layer: MFA on every VPN profile, device posture checks before granting access, gateway firmware patched urgently. Environment layer: Zero-trust access: device compliance + MFA per application, not per network.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Deleting the malicious GPO without removing the persistence it already deployed to thousands of hosts.
- Missing GPO-based deployment because you hunted only local persistence mechanisms.
