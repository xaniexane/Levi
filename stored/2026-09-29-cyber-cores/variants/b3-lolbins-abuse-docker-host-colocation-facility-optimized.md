# Living-off-the-Land Binaries Abuse Defense for Docker Hosts in Colocation Facilities (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers use built-in tools (certutil, bitsadmin, mshta, rundll32, wmic) for download, execution, and exfiltration — no malware to signature. Defense is behavioral: baseline normal LOLBin usage and alert on anomalous parents, arguments, and network activity. Applies to Docker Hosts in Colocation Facilities at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- LOLBins spawned by Office apps, browsers, or scripts with network arguments (certutil -urlcache, bitsadmin /transfer) — parents that never legitimately drive them.
- Encoded or obfuscated arguments, downloads to temp/appdata, or LOLBin-initiated outbound connections.
- Rare LOLBins (mshta, regsvr32, cmstp) executing at all in environments that never use them legitimately.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Docker daemon logs + host auditd + container stdout/stderr shipped centrally. Customer-owned network taps and logging (the colo provider's logs are out of scope — verify contractually).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Badge/physical access logs from the facility correlated with remote-hand ticket times.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Docker daemon log (container create/start with full flags), docker events history and Container image digests and layer histories (docker history) versus expected digests; run `docker ps --format '{{.Names}} {{.Image}}' ; echo ---; docker events --since 24h --until 0s 2>/dev/null | tail -20` then `docker inspect $(docker ps -q) --format '{{.Name}} privileged={{.HostConfig.Privileged}} mounts={{.Mounts}}' 2>/dev/null`.
3. **Analyze.** Reconstruct the full command line — the arguments reveal intent (download URL, payload path, execution method). Then: Check whether the LOLBin fetched a second stage; if so, the investigation continues at the downloaded payload.
4. **Contain and harden.** Application control policies blocking LOLBin network/download primitives where unused; constrained language mode for PowerShell. Asset layer: No --privileged, no host socket mounts except for explicit agents, user namespaces enabled, read-only root filesystems. Environment layer: Locked cabinets, private cages, and escort policies for remote hands.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Blocking a LOLBin outright and breaking admin workflows — constrain by parent and argument, not by existence.
- Missing LOLBin use on Linux/macOS (curl, wget, python) while hunting Windows only.
