# Windows Privilege Escalation Defense for DNS Servers in GCP Cloud (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

From standard user to SYSTEM/Administrator via unquoted service paths, writable service binaries, AlwaysInstallElevated, token manipulation, or kernel exploits. Windows privesc is usually a misconfiguration the attacker read, not a zero-day they brought. Applies to DNS Servers in GCP Cloud at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- Service creation or modification events (7045/4697) pointing at user-writable paths, or processes spawning as SYSTEM from unexpected parents.
- Registry writes to AlwaysInstallElevated keys, accessibility binary replacement (sethc/utilman), or token duplication API patterns in EDR telemetry.
- Enumeration tooling: whoami /priv, accesschk, or PowerShell privesc scripts running before the escalation.
- Lens: Best telemetry: query logs (or passive DNS) + zone-transfer/change audit + resolver cache stats. Cloud Audit Logs (admin + data access) exported to a locked-down logging project.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Security Command Center findings and VPC flow logs centralized.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in DNS query logs showing tunneling/DGA patterns; zone files and their change history and Zone-transfer (AXFR) request logs; DNSSEC validation failure logs; run `grep -E '.{60,}' /var/log/named/query.log | tail -20   # long labels: tunneling/DGA` then `rndc status; echo ---; journalctl -u named --since '1 hour ago' | grep -iE 'transfer|denied|error' | tail -15`.
3. **Analyze.** Pin down the primitive: unquoted path, weak service ACL, scheduled task with stored creds, or kernel CVE — then check how many fleet hosts share it. Then: Review what the elevated access touched: SAM/LSASS access after escalation means credential theft followed.
4. **Contain and harden.** Fix service ACLs and paths fleet-wide, disable AlwaysInstallElevated, and enforce signed-driver and LSA protection policies. Asset layer: Restrict recursion to internal clients, block outbound port 53 except resolvers, DNSSEC validation on. Environment layer: Organization policies constraining public exposure, API enablement, and service-account key creation.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Reimaging one host while the GPO-deployed misconfiguration recreates the hole on every rebuild.
- Missing that the attacker already dumped credentials post-escalation — scope the follow-on theft, not just the privesc.
