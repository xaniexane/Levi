# Pass-the-Hash Defense for Windows Servers in AWS Cloud (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Stolen NTLM hashes authenticate without the password ever being cracked. It is invisible to password monitoring because no password is used — defense means killing NTLM where possible and watching for its telltale logon patterns. Applies to Windows Servers in AWS Cloud at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- 4624 type-3/9 logons using NTLM where Kerberos is expected, especially from workstations to servers with admin accounts.
- Logon sessions with no interactive activity but successful authentication, or the same hash authenticating from multiple hosts simultaneously.
- NTLM audit logs showing authentication for accounts that should be Kerberos-only.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Security log with advanced audit policy + Sysmon + service-install monitoring. Organization CloudTrail in all regions, GuardDuty, and VPC flow logs shipped to the security account.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to CloudWatch and workload logs centralized; S3 access logging on sensitive buckets.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Security log (7045 service installs, 4720 account creation, 4732 group changes) and IIS/HTTP.sys logs for web-facing roles; scheduled-task store in C:\Windows\System32\Tasks; run `Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='System'; Id=7045} | Select-Object -First 20 TimeCreated, Message` then `Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq 'Running'} | ForEach-Object { Get-CimInstance Win32_Service -Filter "Name='$($_.Name)'" | Select-Object Name, PathName, StartName }`.
3. **Analyze.** Determine hash source: LSASS dump, SAM extraction, or DCSync — each implies a different prior compromise to remediate. Then: List every host the hash authenticated to; each is a foothold until reimaged or verified clean.
4. **Contain and harden.** Reduce NTLM usage (audit mode first, then restrict), deploy Credential Guard, and use unique local admin passwords (LAPS). Asset layer: Server Core installs where possible; disable unnecessary roles and SMBv1; enforce SMB signing. Environment layer: SCPs as guardrails (deny leaving org, deny disabling logging, region restrictions).
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Resetting the password without considering that the attacker may have dumped the NEW hash too if still present.
- Disabling NTLM blindly and breaking legacy apps — audit first, restrict second.
