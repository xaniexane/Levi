# Backup Tampering Defense for macOS Endpoints in Branch Offices (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers delete, encrypt, or corrupt backups before the main attack so recovery is impossible. Backup systems are targeted FIRST in modern ransomware — monitor them as the crown jewels they are. Applies to macOS Endpoints in Branch Offices at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- Backup job deletions, retention policy changes, or repository credential changes outside change windows.
- Backup admin console logons from unusual accounts or hosts, or mass snapshot deletions in cloud backup vaults.
- Backup integrity check failures or sudden drops in restorable recovery points.
- Lens: Best telemetry: unified log + EDR agent + Santa/Munki logs where deployed. SD-WAN/branch firewall logs forwarded centrally; local DHCP/DNS logs for device attribution.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NAC or port-level logs identifying which device was on which port during the incident.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Unified log (log show) for process execution and auth events; login items and LaunchAgents/LaunchDaemons plists and Quarantine attributes (xattr com.apple.quarantine) on downloads; Gatekeeper assessment history; run `log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "sshd"' --last 2h | tail -20` then `ls -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ /Library/LaunchDaemons/ /Library/LaunchAgents/ 2>/dev/null`.
3. **Analyze.** Determine which recovery points were destroyed versus merely marked deleted — cloud soft-delete and immutable vaults may still hold copies. Then: Identify how the attacker reached the backup system: shared credentials, unpatched console, or compromised admin.
4. **Contain and harden.** Immutable backup storage (object lock / immutable vaults) with separate credentials and MFA on the backup console. Asset layer: Gatekeeper + XProtect current, FileVault on, firewall on, and MDM-enforced configuration profiles. Environment layer: Standardized branch firewall policy deployed as code; no local admin exceptions.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Backups on the same domain credentials as production — the attacker uses the same keys on both.
- Monitoring backup job success but never testing an actual restore.
