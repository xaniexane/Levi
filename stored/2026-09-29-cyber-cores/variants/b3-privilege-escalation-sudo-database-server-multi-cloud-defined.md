# Linux Privilege Escalation Defense for Database Servers in Multi-Cloud (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers turn a low-privilege Linux foothold into root via sudo misconfigurations, SUID binaries, kernel exploits, or writable service files. Harden the escalation paths and you contain most Linux intrusions at the beachhead. Applies to Database Servers in Multi-Cloud at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- Sudo invocations of unusual binaries, sudoers file reads by non-admins, or successful sudo from accounts that never used it before.
- Execution of known privesc enumeration scripts (LinPEAS-style), SUID binary abuse, or kernel exploit artifacts in logs.
- New entries in sudoers.d, unexpected SUID bits, or service files modified by non-root users.
- Lens: Best telemetry: query audit logs (who ran what) + auth logs + backup/restore history. Cloud-agnostic SIEM normalizing AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Log, and GCP Audit Logs into one schema.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to CSPM coverage across all clouds with consistent misconfiguration alerting.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Database audit log: logons, privileged statements (DCL/DDL), and bulk-export queries and Slow/general query logs around the incident window; new users, roles, or linked servers; run `-- PostgreSQL style:` then `SELECT usename, query, query_start FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state='active' ORDER BY query_start;`.
3. **Analyze.** Identify the exact escalation primitive: which misconfiguration or vulnerability was used, and whether it is systemic across the fleet or host-specific. Then: Check for persistence installed with the new privileges: new SSH keys in root's authorized_keys, cron jobs, or systemd units.
4. **Contain and harden.** Least-privilege sudoers (no NOPASSWD, no wildcards), remove SUID from unnecessary binaries, and keep kernels patched. Asset layer: Least-privilege DB roles, no app superusers, encrypted connections, auditing on privileged actions. Environment layer: Federated identity across clouds from one IdP; consistent tagging and logging standards per cloud.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Cleaning the host without fixing the fleet-wide sudoers misconfiguration that enabled it.
- Assuming container escape is out of scope — check whether the foothold was a container with host mounts.
