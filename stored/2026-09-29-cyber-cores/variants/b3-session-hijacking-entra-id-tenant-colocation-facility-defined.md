# Web Session Hijacking Defense for Microsoft Entra ID Tenants in Colocation Facilities (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Stolen session cookies let attackers ride authenticated web sessions without credentials or MFA. Cookie theft via infostealer or XSS is the usual source; concurrent-session anomalies are the usual signal. Applies to Microsoft Entra ID Tenants in Colocation Facilities at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- The same session active from two geographies or ASNs simultaneously, or a session suddenly continuing from a datacenter IP.
- Session created without a fresh authentication event (cookie replay), or user-agent/IP changing mid-session.
- Infostealer execution on the user's device shortly before the anomalous session.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Entra sign-in + audit logs streamed to Log Analytics/SIEM with 30+ day retention. Customer-owned network taps and logging (the colo provider's logs are out of scope — verify contractually).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Badge/physical access logs from the facility correlated with remote-hand ticket times.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Sign-in logs (interactive, non-interactive, service principal) with risk detections and MFA details and Audit logs: app registrations, consent grants, Conditional Access changes, role assignments; run `# Microsoft Graph (delegated admin): recent risky sign-ins` then `Get-MgAuditLogSignIn -Filter "riskState eq 'atRisk'" -Top 25 | Select-Object CreatedDateTime, UserPrincipalName, IpAddress, @{n='Risk';e={$_.RiskDetail}}`.
3. **Analyze.** Determine the theft vector: device compromise (cookie files exfiltrated) versus application XSS — the fix differs. Then: Inventory actions taken in the hijacked session: data viewed, settings changed, transactions performed.
4. **Contain and harden.** Short session lifetimes, binding sessions to device/IP characteristics, and step-up auth for sensitive actions. Asset layer: Conditional Access: require phishing-resistant MFA, compliant devices, block legacy auth and risky sign-ins. Environment layer: Locked cabinets, private cages, and escort policies for remote hands.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Invalidating the password but not the session — the hijacker stays logged in.
- Missing that the user's DEVICE is compromised; the next session gets stolen too until the infostealer is removed.
