# Golden Ticket Attack Defense for Firewall Appliances in GCP Cloud (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

Forged Kerberos TGTs using the stolen krbtgt hash grant unrestricted, long-lived domain access that survives password resets. Detection relies on ticket anomalies: impossible lifetimes, wrong encryption, or logons that bypass the DC. Applies to Firewall Appliances in GCP Cloud at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- TGTs with lifetimes far exceeding domain policy (e.g., 10 years), RC4-encrypted tickets in an AES-enforced domain, or tickets for accounts that never authenticated (no 4768).
- 4769 service-ticket requests referencing a TGT the DC never issued, or logons from hosts with no corresponding interactive session.
- The krbtgt account's own anomalous activity following a DCSync event.
- Lens: Best telemetry: traffic/deny logs + admin audit log + config-change diffs shipped to SIEM. Cloud Audit Logs (admin + data access) exported to a locked-down logging project.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Security Command Center findings and VPC flow logs centralized.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Traffic logs (allowed/denied with rule IDs), threat logs (IPS/AV verdicts), admin audit log and Configuration revisions and diffs; VPN session logs and authentication failures; run `# vendor CLIs differ; conceptually:` then `show log traffic query (source <suspect-ip>)             # Palo Alto style`.
3. **Analyze.** Confirm via ticket inspection (klist, network capture): lifetime, encryption type, and client name mismatches prove forgery. Then: Scope everything done under forged tickets — assume full domain compromise until proven otherwise.
4. **Contain and harden.** Rotate the krbtgt password TWICE (to invalidate both current and previous hash) after any suspected compromise. Asset layer: Default-deny with documented rules, admin on dedicated interface with MFA, config backups versioned. Environment layer: Organization policies constraining public exposure, API enablement, and service-account key creation.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Rotating krbtgt only once — the N-1 hash remains valid and the golden ticket still works.
- Treating it as an account incident instead of a domain-trust incident; the response scope is the whole forest.
