# MFA Fatigue Attack Defense for Container Registries in On-Premises Datacenter (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers with a stolen password spam push notifications until the victim approves one out of annoyance or confusion. The defense is push hygiene: number matching, context display, and rate limits on prompts. Applies to Container Registries in On-Premises Datacenter at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- Dozens of MFA push prompts to one user in minutes, especially at odd hours, followed by a single approval.
- An approval immediately followed by session activity from an unusual IP or device enrollment changes.
- Helpdesk reports of users 'getting lots of MFA prompts' in the days before the incident.
- Lens: Best telemetry: push/pull audit logs + image-scan results + signature verification logs. Full network tap/SPAN coverage at core and distribution layers feeding IDS and full-packet capture.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Centralized syslog from all infrastructure with NTP-synced timestamps for cross-device correlation.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Push/pull audit log (who pushed which tag/digest, who pulled it, from where) and Vulnerability scan results per image; signature (cosign/Notary) verification outcomes; run `reg audit log --since 7d --action push | head -30` then `reg scan results --image <image:tag> --severity high,critical`.
3. **Analyze.** Reconstruct the prompt storm: count, timing, and the approving event — then inventory the attacker's post-approval actions. Then: Check whether the attacker registered a new MFA method during the session (persistence via second factor).
4. **Contain and harden.** Number matching on all push MFA, show login context (app, location), and rate-limit prompts per user. Asset layer: Image signing required, immutable tags for releases, vulnerability gates blocking critical CVEs. Environment layer: Physical access controls with badge logs correlatable to logical access during investigations.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Assuming an approved push means a legitimate user — approval is exactly what the attacker engineered.
- Not checking for newly registered MFA methods, which survive password resets.
