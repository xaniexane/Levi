# Cryptominer Intrusion Defense for Linux Servers in AWS Cloud (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Unauthorized miners burn CPU/GPU and cloud spend, and — more importantly — prove an attacker has code execution on your assets. Treat every miner as a foothold to investigate, not just a performance problem. Applies to Linux Servers in AWS Cloud at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- Sustained high CPU/GPU on hosts or cloud instances with no business workload, especially at night/weekends, plus connections to known mining pools on Stratum ports.
- Cloud billing spikes for compute in regions you do not use, or new instances launched by unfamiliar principals.
- EDR detections for xmrig or similar binaries, scheduled tasks re-fetching miner payloads, or WMI persistence entries.
- Lens: Best telemetry: auditd + centralized syslog/journald + osquery or an EDR agent. Organization CloudTrail in all regions, GuardDuty, and VPC flow logs shipped to the security account.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to CloudWatch and workload logs centralized; S3 access logging on sensitive buckets.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in auth.log/secure (SSH logons), auditd logs (execve, file writes), and cron tables (/etc/crontab, /etc/cron.d/*, user crontabs) and systemd unit files in /etc/systemd/system/ and SSH authorized_keys files for all users; run `sudo grep -E 'Failed|Accepted' /var/log/auth.log | tail -40` then `sudo ausearch -m EXECVE --start recent -i | grep -E 'curl|wget|bash|sh|python|perl' | tail -30`.
3. **Analyze.** Trace the miner's persistence and delivery: the initial access vector (exposed service, weak SSH, vulnerable app) matters more than the miner itself. Then: Check for dual-use: many miner campaigns also exfiltrate credentials or deploy additional payloads — sweep for those.
4. **Contain and harden.** Close the entry vector (patch the exploited service, enforce key-based SSH, remove internet exposure), then block mining pool domains at DNS. Asset layer: Key-only SSH (no passwords), fail2ban or equivalent, unattended security updates enabled. Environment layer: SCPs as guardrails (deny leaving org, deny disabling logging, region restrictions).
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Killing the miner without removing persistence — it returns on reboot or on schedule.
- Writing it off as 'just a miner' without investigating the initial access that delivered it.
