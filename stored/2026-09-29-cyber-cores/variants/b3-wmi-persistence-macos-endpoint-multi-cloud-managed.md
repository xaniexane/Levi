# WMI Persistence Defense for macOS Endpoints in Multi-Cloud (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

WMI event subscriptions trigger payloads on system events (timers, logons) with no visible scheduled task or service. They are fileless, stealthy, and missed by autorun tools that do not enumerate the WMI repository. Applies to macOS Endpoints in Multi-Cloud at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- New __EventFilter/__EventConsumer/__FilterToConsumerBinding instances in the WMI repository, especially ActiveScript or CommandLine consumers with encoded commands.
- WmiPrvSE.exe spawning powershell/cmd at odd times, or WMI operational log entries for subscription creation.
- Persistence that survives task/service cleanup — the classic sign the mechanism is WMI-based.
- Lens: Best telemetry: unified log + EDR agent + Santa/Munki logs where deployed. Cloud-agnostic SIEM normalizing AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Log, and GCP Audit Logs into one schema.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to CSPM coverage across all clouds with consistent misconfiguration alerting.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Unified log (log show) for process execution and auth events; login items and LaunchAgents/LaunchDaemons plists and Quarantine attributes (xattr com.apple.quarantine) on downloads; Gatekeeper assessment history; run `log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "sshd"' --last 2h | tail -20` then `ls -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ /Library/LaunchDaemons/ /Library/LaunchAgents/ 2>/dev/null`.
3. **Analyze.** Enumerate all event subscriptions (Get-WMIObject -Namespace root\subscription) and inspect each consumer's command line. Then: Correlate subscription creation time with the initial compromise to confirm it is attacker-planted, not admin tooling.
4. **Contain and harden.** Alert on WMI subscription creation events; restrict WMI namespace permissions to administrators. Asset layer: Gatekeeper + XProtect current, FileVault on, firewall on, and MDM-enforced configuration profiles. Environment layer: Federated identity across clouds from one IdP; consistent tagging and logging standards per cloud.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Declaring a host clean after checking tasks/services/registry but never looking at WMI subscriptions.
- Removing the consumer but leaving the filter and binding, which error silently and get recreated by the implant.
