# WMI Persistence Defense for Windows Servers in On-Premises Datacenter (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

WMI event subscriptions trigger payloads on system events (timers, logons) with no visible scheduled task or service. They are fileless, stealthy, and missed by autorun tools that do not enumerate the WMI repository. Applies to Windows Servers in On-Premises Datacenter at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- New __EventFilter/__EventConsumer/__FilterToConsumerBinding instances in the WMI repository, especially ActiveScript or CommandLine consumers with encoded commands.
- WmiPrvSE.exe spawning powershell/cmd at odd times, or WMI operational log entries for subscription creation.
- Persistence that survives task/service cleanup — the classic sign the mechanism is WMI-based.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Security log with advanced audit policy + Sysmon + service-install monitoring. Full network tap/SPAN coverage at core and distribution layers feeding IDS and full-packet capture.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Centralized syslog from all infrastructure with NTP-synced timestamps for cross-device correlation.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Security log (7045 service installs, 4720 account creation, 4732 group changes) and IIS/HTTP.sys logs for web-facing roles; scheduled-task store in C:\Windows\System32\Tasks; run `Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='System'; Id=7045} | Select-Object -First 20 TimeCreated, Message` then `Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq 'Running'} | ForEach-Object { Get-CimInstance Win32_Service -Filter "Name='$($_.Name)'" | Select-Object Name, PathName, StartName }`.
3. **Analyze.** Enumerate all event subscriptions (Get-WMIObject -Namespace root\subscription) and inspect each consumer's command line. Then: Correlate subscription creation time with the initial compromise to confirm it is attacker-planted, not admin tooling.
4. **Contain and harden.** Alert on WMI subscription creation events; restrict WMI namespace permissions to administrators. Asset layer: Server Core installs where possible; disable unnecessary roles and SMBv1; enforce SMB signing. Environment layer: Physical access controls with badge logs correlatable to logical access during investigations.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Declaring a host clean after checking tasks/services/registry but never looking at WMI subscriptions.
- Removing the consumer but leaving the filter and binding, which error silently and get recreated by the implant.
