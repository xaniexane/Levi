# RDP Lateral Movement Defense for EDR Consoles in Remote Workforce (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

RDP is both an admin tool and the attacker's favorite lateral highway. Compromised credentials plus unrestricted RDP equals domain-wide movement that looks almost legitimate in the logs. Applies to EDR Consoles in Remote Workforce at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- 4624 type-10 (RDP) logons from a workstation to servers or other workstations outside the user's normal admin pattern.
- RDP sessions at unusual hours, from hosts the account never logged into before, or with clipboard/drive redirection moving tools onto the target.
- TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager events (21/25) on targets without a matching helpdesk ticket or change record.
- Lens: Best telemetry: raw process/network telemetry + detection history + sensor health inventory. EDR on every endpoint as the primary sensor (no corporate network tap for remote hosts).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to VPN/ZTNA access logs and SaaS/IdP sign-in logs as the network-visibility substitute.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Full process trees with command lines, hashes, and network connections for suspect hosts and Detection and response action history (isolations, kills, quarantines); run `# conceptually (EDR APIs differ):` then `edr-cli hunt process --hostname <host> --since 24h --tree`.
3. **Analyze.** Correlate RDP logons with the source host's compromise timeline to distinguish attacker sessions from legitimate admin work. Then: Check for credential harvesting on each RDP target: LSASS access or SAM reads following the session indicate theft.
4. **Contain and harden.** RDP restricted to jump hosts/bastions with MFA; Network Level Authentication enforced; no direct workstation-to-server RDP. Asset layer: Tamper protection locked with console-only disable, auto-isolation policies for high-severity detections. Environment layer: Zero-trust access: device compliance + MFA per application, not per network.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Allowing 'temporary' RDP exceptions that become permanent lateral paths.
- Missing RDP-based movement because you only hunted SMB — attackers use whatever is open.
