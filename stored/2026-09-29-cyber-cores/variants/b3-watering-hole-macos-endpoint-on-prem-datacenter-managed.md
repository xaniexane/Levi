# Watering Hole Attack Defense for macOS Endpoints in On-Premises Datacenter (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers compromise websites your targets frequent, turning trusted browsing into infection. Detection is epidemiological: multiple infections sharing one browsing history overlap. Applies to macOS Endpoints in On-Premises Datacenter at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- Several hosts infected with the same payload whose proxy histories share a common site visited shortly before each infection.
- A trusted industry/partner site serving malicious scripts or redirects (verified via sandbox fetch).
- Infections clustered by department or role matching the compromised site's audience.
- Lens: Best telemetry: unified log + EDR agent + Santa/Munki logs where deployed. Full network tap/SPAN coverage at core and distribution layers feeding IDS and full-packet capture.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Centralized syslog from all infrastructure with NTP-synced timestamps for cross-device correlation.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Unified log (log show) for process execution and auth events; login items and LaunchAgents/LaunchDaemons plists and Quarantine attributes (xattr com.apple.quarantine) on downloads; Gatekeeper assessment history; run `log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "sshd"' --last 2h | tail -20` then `ls -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ /Library/LaunchDaemons/ /Library/LaunchAgents/ 2>/dev/null`.
3. **Analyze.** Confirm the watering hole by fetching the suspect site in a sandbox and capturing the injected code. Then: Enumerate all visitors to the site in the compromise window — the exposed population, not just the infected.
4. **Contain and harden.** Notify the site owner; block the malicious URLs/paths (not necessarily the whole domain) at the proxy. Asset layer: Gatekeeper + XProtect current, FileVault on, firewall on, and MDM-enforced configuration profiles. Environment layer: Physical access controls with badge logs correlatable to logical access during investigations.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Treating each infection as independent and missing the common source — always compare browsing histories across cases.
- Blocking the entire legitimate domain permanently instead of the injected path, breaking business access.
