# Phishing Credential Harvest Defense for GCP Projects in GCP Cloud (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Users are lured to lookalike login pages (often via adversary-in-the-middle kits that relay MFA) and submit credentials. The defender's job: find who clicked, who submitted, and whether sessions were hijacked even where MFA appeared to hold. Applies to GCP Projects in GCP Cloud at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- Email gateway logs show a burst of messages with lookalike domains, newly registered domains, or QR-code lures pointing at a credential-harvest kit URL.
- Proxy/DNS logs show visits to the kit domain followed within minutes by logons from unusual IPs or impossible-travel pairs for the same user.
- AiTM kits leave telltales: logon session created without a matching MFA challenge event, or token replay from datacenter IP ranges.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Cloud Audit Logs (Admin Activity + Data Access) + Security Command Center + VPC flow logs. Cloud Audit Logs (admin + data access) exported to a locked-down logging project.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Security Command Center findings and VPC flow logs centralized.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Cloud Audit Logs: setIamPolicy, storage.setIamPermissions, compute inserts, and console logons and Security Command Center findings; Forseti/Config Validator drift reports where deployed; run `gcloud logging read 'protoPayload.methodName:"SetIamPolicy"' --limit 20 --format='table(timestamp, protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail, resourceName)'` then `gcloud scc findings list organizations/$ORG_ID --filter='state="ACTIVE"' --limit 15`.
3. **Analyze.** Pull the kit URL from the email, fetch it in a sandbox, and extract the credential-post endpoint and any session-cookie exfiltration to scope which submissions completed. Then: For each submitter, check for concurrent sessions: revoke all refresh tokens and list OAuth app consents granted in the phish window.
4. **Contain and harden.** Move to phishing-resistant MFA (FIDO2/WebAuthn); TOTP and push MFA fall to AiTM relay. Asset layer: Organization policies: no public buckets, no default SA use, OS Login on; deny unapproved APIs. Environment layer: Organization policies constraining public exposure, API enablement, and service-account key creation.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Resetting the password without revoking sessions leaves the attacker logged in via stolen tokens.
- Blaming the clicker instead of fixing the control gap guarantees a repeat with a better lure.
