# Living-off-the-Land Binaries Abuse Defense for SSO Identity Providers in Azure Cloud (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers use built-in tools (certutil, bitsadmin, mshta, rundll32, wmic) for download, execution, and exfiltration — no malware to signature. Defense is behavioral: baseline normal LOLBin usage and alert on anomalous parents, arguments, and network activity. Applies to SSO Identity Providers in Azure Cloud at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- LOLBins spawned by Office apps, browsers, or scripts with network arguments (certutil -urlcache, bitsadmin /transfer) — parents that never legitimately drive them.
- Encoded or obfuscated arguments, downloads to temp/appdata, or LOLBin-initiated outbound connections.
- Rare LOLBins (mshta, regsvr32, cmstp) executing at all in environments that never use them legitimately.
- Lens: Best telemetry: authentication logs with MFA detail + app-assignment changes + federation trust changes. Activity Log and Entra sign-in/audit logs streamed to Log Analytics/SIEM; Defender for Cloud alerts.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NSG flow logs and storage analytics for data-plane visibility.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Authentication logs per application (success/failure, MFA method, device, location) and Application assignment and provisioning logs; new SSO integrations; run `# conceptually (IdP APIs differ):` then `idp-cli logs auth --user <upn> --last 7d --format table | head -25`.
3. **Analyze.** Reconstruct the full command line — the arguments reveal intent (download URL, payload path, execution method). Then: Check whether the LOLBin fetched a second stage; if so, the investigation continues at the downloaded payload.
4. **Contain and harden.** Application control policies blocking LOLBin network/download primitives where unused; constrained language mode for PowerShell. Asset layer: Phishing-resistant MFA default, sign-on policies per app risk, session lifetime limits. Environment layer: Azure Policy deny-effects on risky configurations; PIM-gated subscription roles.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Blocking a LOLBin outright and breaking admin workflows — constrain by parent and argument, not by existence.
- Missing LOLBin use on Linux/macOS (curl, wget, python) while hunting Windows only.
