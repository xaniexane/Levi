# Registry Persistence Defense for Proxy Servers in AWS Cloud (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Run keys, services, Winlogon helpers, and COM hijacks give attackers reboot-surviving execution with minimal footprint. Baseline the autoruns on gold images; alert on deviations, not on the mechanism's existence. Applies to Proxy Servers in AWS Cloud at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- Writes to Run/RunOnce keys, Winlogon Userinit/Shell values, or service ImagePath entries pointing at unusual binaries.
- Sysmon event 13 (registry value set) on autorun locations by non-installer processes, or new services with suspicious binaries.
- Autoruns deltas: new entries appearing between baseline scans on hosts with no software-change record.
- Lens: Best telemetry: full URL logs with user identity + TLS SNI logs + block/allow verdicts. Organization CloudTrail in all regions, GuardDuty, and VPC flow logs shipped to the security account.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to CloudWatch and workload logs centralized; S3 access logging on sensitive buckets.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Access logs (user, URL, category, verdict, bytes) for the incident window and Blocked-request logs showing attempted C2/malware/phishing destinations; run `grep <username> /var/log/squid/access.log | awk '{print $7}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20` then `grep -E 'TCP_DENIED|BLOCK' /var/log/squid/access.log | tail -30`.
3. **Analyze.** Capture the referenced binary: hash, signature, and sandbox detonation to confirm malicious intent. Then: Check the same autorun locations across the fleet — registry persistence is often deployed identically to many hosts.
4. **Contain and harden.** Scheduled Autoruns/Sysmon baselining with alerting on new persistence entries; restrict registry write rights for standard users. Asset layer: Authenticated proxying (no anonymous egress), category blocking, TLS inspection where policy allows. Environment layer: SCPs as guardrails (deny leaving org, deny disabling logging, region restrictions).
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Cleaning the registry value while the dropper that restores it still runs on a schedule.
- Overlooking user-hive (HKCU) persistence during a 'system-only' triage.
