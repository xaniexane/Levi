# Public API Abuse Defense for CI/CD Runners in On-Premises Datacenter (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Exposed APIs are probed for injection, broken auth, and excessive data exposure. API abuse looks like legitimate traffic at volume — detection needs API-aware logging (endpoint, parameters, auth context), not just web logs. Applies to CI/CD Runners in On-Premises Datacenter at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- High-rate 4xx/5xx sequences against API endpoints indicating fuzzing, or single clients enumerating object IDs sequentially.
- Authenticated API calls accessing other users' objects (BOLA/IDOR patterns) or returning bulk data far beyond normal use.
- Known attack strings (SQLi, SSTI payloads) in API parameters.
- Lens: Best telemetry: job execution logs + runner registration events + secret-access audit. Full network tap/SPAN coverage at core and distribution layers feeding IDS and full-packet capture.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Centralized syslog from all infrastructure with NTP-synced timestamps for cross-device correlation.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Job logs with executed commands and exit codes for suspect runs and Runner registration/deregistration events and runner version inventory; run `runner-cli jobs list --status failed --last 7d | head -20` then `runner-cli runners list --format table`.
3. **Analyze.** Replay the suspect API sessions to determine exactly which records were accessed — the breach scope is the data returned, not the requests made. Then: Check whether the abused endpoint lacks authorization checks versus a credentialed attacker using stolen tokens.
4. **Contain and harden.** Positive-security API gateway policies: schema validation, rate limits per client, and authorization checks on every object reference. Asset layer: Ephemeral isolated runners, OIDC short-lived credentials, no persistent secrets on runners. Environment layer: Physical access controls with badge logs correlatable to logical access during investigations.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- WAF-only defense: most API abuse is semantically valid HTTP that no signature catches.
- Logging without the auth context — you cannot distinguish attack from customer without knowing WHO called.
