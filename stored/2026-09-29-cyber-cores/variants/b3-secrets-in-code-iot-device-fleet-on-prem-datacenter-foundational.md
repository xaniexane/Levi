# Secrets in Code Defense for IoT Device Fleets in On-Premises Datacenter (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

API keys, passwords, and tokens committed to repositories get scraped by attackers (and by every future repo reader). A committed secret is a compromised secret — rotate first, clean history second. Applies to IoT Device Fleets in On-Premises Datacenter at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- Secret-scanning alerts (push protection or historical scan) flagging keys, tokens, or private keys in commits.
- Anomalous API usage billed to a key that appears in a repository, or commits adding '.env' files.
- Public repository exposure: any secret ever pushed public is considered harvested.
- Lens: Best telemetry: device heartbeat/status + firmware version inventory + network flow from IoT VLAN. Full network tap/SPAN coverage at core and distribution layers feeding IDS and full-packet capture.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Centralized syslog from all infrastructure with NTP-synced timestamps for cross-device correlation.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Device inventory with firmware versions and last-seen timestamps and Network flows from the IoT segment (unexpected destinations, scanning behavior); run `nmap -sn 192.0.2.0/24 2>/dev/null | grep -E 'Nmap scan|MAC' | head -40   # authorized scan only` then `grep <device-ip> /var/log/iot-flows.log | awk '{print $5}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -15`.
3. **Analyze.** For each exposed secret: determine its privileges and check usage logs for unauthorized use since exposure. Then: Check git history depth: secrets in old commits are still exposed to anyone with repo access.
4. **Contain and harden.** Rotate the secret FIRST, then purge from history; enable push protection and pre-commit secret scanning. Asset layer: Dedicated VLAN with no internet egress except via proxy, unique credentials per device, firmware update process. Environment layer: Physical access controls with badge logs correlatable to logical access during investigations.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Deleting the commit without rotating — the secret is already copied.
- Scanning only main branch; secrets hide in feature branches, PRs, and forks.
