# DNS Tunneling Defense for Azure Subscriptions in Colocation Facilities (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

DNS tunneling smuggles data or C2 inside DNS queries, abusing a protocol almost every network allows outbound. Detection hinges on query shape (length, entropy, volume, record types), not on blocklists. Applies to Azure Subscriptions in Colocation Facilities at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- Long, high-entropy subdomains (often 50+ chars) in DNS logs, unusual record types (TXT, NULL) at volume, or a single host generating thousands of queries to one domain.
- Beacon-like regularity in query timing to an obscure domain, or DNS queries for domains registered within the last 30 days.
- Responses with abnormally large TXT records relative to the query — data coming back down the tunnel.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Activity Log + Entra sign-in logs + Defender for Cloud + NSG flow logs. Customer-owned network taps and logging (the colo provider's logs are out of scope — verify contractually).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Badge/physical access logs from the facility correlated with remote-hand ticket times.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Azure Activity Log (write/delete on IAM, policy, network) and Entra audit/sign-in logs and Defender for Cloud recommendations and alerts; resource-change history; run `az monitor activity-log list --max-events 25 --query '[].{time:eventTimestamp, op:operationName.value, caller:caller}' -o table` then `az security alert list --query '[].{name:alertDisplayName, severity:severity, time:timeGeneratedUtc}' -o table`.
3. **Analyze.** Decode a sample of tunneled queries/responses in a sandbox to determine direction and content: C2 instructions, exfiltrated data, or both. Then: Identify patient zero by earliest query timestamp, then hunt laterally: tunneling tools are often deployed to multiple hosts.
4. **Contain and harden.** Force all DNS through logged, filtered resolvers; block direct port-53 egress from endpoints and alert on non-standard DNS ports. Asset layer: Azure Policy deny-effects on public storage/exposure; PIM for subscription roles; Defender plans on. Environment layer: Locked cabinets, private cages, and escort policies for remote hands.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Blocking the domain without finding the implant — the attacker rotates domains faster than you blocklist.
- Ignoring DNS over HTTPS (DoH): tunneled traffic inside DoH is invisible to passive DNS monitoring — log at the endpoint.
