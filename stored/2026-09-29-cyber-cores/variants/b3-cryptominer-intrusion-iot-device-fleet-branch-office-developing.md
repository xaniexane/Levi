# Cryptominer Intrusion Defense for IoT Device Fleets in Branch Offices (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Unauthorized miners burn CPU/GPU and cloud spend, and — more importantly — prove an attacker has code execution on your assets. Treat every miner as a foothold to investigate, not just a performance problem. Applies to IoT Device Fleets in Branch Offices at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- Sustained high CPU/GPU on hosts or cloud instances with no business workload, especially at night/weekends, plus connections to known mining pools on Stratum ports.
- Cloud billing spikes for compute in regions you do not use, or new instances launched by unfamiliar principals.
- EDR detections for xmrig or similar binaries, scheduled tasks re-fetching miner payloads, or WMI persistence entries.
- Lens: Best telemetry: device heartbeat/status + firmware version inventory + network flow from IoT VLAN. SD-WAN/branch firewall logs forwarded centrally; local DHCP/DNS logs for device attribution.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NAC or port-level logs identifying which device was on which port during the incident.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Device inventory with firmware versions and last-seen timestamps and Network flows from the IoT segment (unexpected destinations, scanning behavior); run `nmap -sn 192.0.2.0/24 2>/dev/null | grep -E 'Nmap scan|MAC' | head -40   # authorized scan only` then `grep <device-ip> /var/log/iot-flows.log | awk '{print $5}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -15`.
3. **Analyze.** Trace the miner's persistence and delivery: the initial access vector (exposed service, weak SSH, vulnerable app) matters more than the miner itself. Then: Check for dual-use: many miner campaigns also exfiltrate credentials or deploy additional payloads — sweep for those.
4. **Contain and harden.** Close the entry vector (patch the exploited service, enforce key-based SSH, remove internet exposure), then block mining pool domains at DNS. Asset layer: Dedicated VLAN with no internet egress except via proxy, unique credentials per device, firmware update process. Environment layer: Standardized branch firewall policy deployed as code; no local admin exceptions.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Killing the miner without removing persistence — it returns on reboot or on schedule.
- Writing it off as 'just a miner' without investigating the initial access that delivered it.
