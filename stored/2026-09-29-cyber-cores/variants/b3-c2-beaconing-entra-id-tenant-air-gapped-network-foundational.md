# C2 Beaconing Defense for Microsoft Entra ID Tenants in Air-Gapped Networks (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

Compromised hosts check in with attacker infrastructure on a schedule — the heartbeat of an intrusion. Beaconing detection is statistical: regularity, jitter analysis, and connection uniformity reveal what signatures miss. Applies to Microsoft Entra ID Tenants in Air-Gapped Networks at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- Outbound connections at fixed intervals (e.g., every 60s) with consistent byte counts to an external host — visible in NetFlow or proxy logs as metronomic traffic.
- Long-lived sessions to IPs with no domain, newly registered domains, or domains with no legitimate business purpose.
- Jittered but statistically regular timing: inter-arrival times clustering around a mean with small variance.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Entra sign-in + audit logs streamed to Log Analytics/SIEM with 30+ day retention. Local SIEM/log collector inside the enclave (no cloud shipping); removable-media transfer logs.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Strict allowlisting logs: every binary execution recorded, since the set is small and known.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Sign-in logs (interactive, non-interactive, service principal) with risk detections and MFA details and Audit logs: app registrations, consent grants, Conditional Access changes, role assignments; run `# Microsoft Graph (delegated admin): recent risky sign-ins` then `Get-MgAuditLogSignIn -Filter "riskState eq 'atRisk'" -Top 25 | Select-Object CreatedDateTime, UserPrincipalName, IpAddress, @{n='Risk';e={$_.RiskDetail}}`.
3. **Analyze.** Compute inter-arrival statistics on the suspect flows; true beacons show low variance even with jitter, unlike human browsing. Then: Capture the beacon payload in a sandbox detonation to identify the implant family and its tasking protocol.
4. **Contain and harden.** Egress filtering: default-deny outbound with allowlisted destinations for servers; alert on direct-to-IP connections. Asset layer: Conditional Access: require phishing-resistant MFA, compliant devices, block legacy auth and risky sign-ins. Environment layer: Data diodes or strictly controlled one-way transfers; media sanitization procedures for anything crossing.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Chasing the C2 IP instead of the implant — infrastructure is disposable, the foothold is what matters.
- Assuming encrypted traffic cannot be analyzed: timing, size, and destination metadata still betray beacons.
