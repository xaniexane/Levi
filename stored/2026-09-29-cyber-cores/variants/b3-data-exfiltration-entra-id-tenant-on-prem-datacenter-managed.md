# Data Exfiltration Defense for Microsoft Entra ID Tenants in On-Premises Datacenter (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Sensitive data leaving the network — the moment an intrusion becomes a breach. Quantifying WHAT left is more important than blocking the channel after the fact; notification obligations depend on the data, not the technique. Applies to Microsoft Entra ID Tenants in On-Premises Datacenter at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- Egress spikes: large uploads to external hosts, cloud storage, or paste sites from servers that normally receive more than they send.
- Staging activity: large archives (zip/7z/rar) created in temp directories, database dumps, or mailbox exports shortly before the transfer.
- DLP alerts on regulated data patterns (SSN, card numbers, PHI formats) in outbound traffic, or DNS/ICMP exfil at low volume.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Entra sign-in + audit logs streamed to Log Analytics/SIEM with 30+ day retention. Full network tap/SPAN coverage at core and distribution layers feeding IDS and full-packet capture.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Centralized syslog from all infrastructure with NTP-synced timestamps for cross-device correlation.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Sign-in logs (interactive, non-interactive, service principal) with risk detections and MFA details and Audit logs: app registrations, consent grants, Conditional Access changes, role assignments; run `# Microsoft Graph (delegated admin): recent risky sign-ins` then `Get-MgAuditLogSignIn -Filter "riskState eq 'atRisk'" -Top 25 | Select-Object CreatedDateTime, UserPrincipalName, IpAddress, @{n='Risk';e={$_.RiskDetail}}`.
3. **Analyze.** Reconstruct the exfil set: source paths, file types, record counts, and data classification — involve legal early for notification scoping. Then: Preserve full packet/proxy logs of the transfer; they prove what left and are evidence for regulators and law enforcement.
4. **Contain and harden.** DLP policies with blocking on bulk sensitive-data egress, plus alerting on archive creation and database dump commands. Asset layer: Conditional Access: require phishing-resistant MFA, compliant devices, block legacy auth and risky sign-ins. Environment layer: Physical access controls with badge logs correlatable to logical access during investigations.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Stopping the transfer but never determining what was in it — you cannot scope a breach on 'we blocked something'.
- Forgetting cloud audit logs: exfil via sanctioned SaaS (personal Drive, Dropbox) bypasses network DLP.
