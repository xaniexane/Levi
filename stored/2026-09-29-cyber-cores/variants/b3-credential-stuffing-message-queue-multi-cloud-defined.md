# Credential Stuffing Defense for Message Queues in Multi-Cloud (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers replay username/password pairs stolen from third-party breaches against your login endpoints, betting on password reuse. It shows up as high-volume failed logons from distributed IPs, occasionally followed by a small number of successful takeovers. Applies to Message Queues in Multi-Cloud at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- Authentication logs show a spike in failed logons (often 100s per minute) from many source IPs against a single login endpoint, with a low success rate and common password patterns.
- Successful logons immediately followed by password or MFA changes, mailbox rule creation, or impossible-travel alerts for the same account within minutes.
- WAF/bot-management flags distributed requests with identical user-agent strings, headless-browser markers, or known credential-stuffing tool signatures.
- Lens: Best telemetry: queue depth/lag metrics + producer/consumer auth logs + dead-letter queues. Cloud-agnostic SIEM normalizing AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Log, and GCP Audit Logs into one schema.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to CSPM coverage across all clouds with consistent misconfiguration alerting.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Queue metrics: depth spikes, consumer lag, and poison-message dead-letter queues and Authentication logs for producers/consumers; new queue/topic creation events; run `rabbitmqctl list_queues name messages consumers 2>/dev/null | head -20` then `kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server <broker> --describe --all-groups 2>/dev/null | head -20`.
3. **Analyze.** Separate spray from stuffing: stuffing reuses many passwords per username from breach corpora; confirm by checking whether the attempted passwords appear in public breach datasets. Then: For each successful post-stuffing logon, inventory session actions: read mail rules, forwarding addresses, OAuth grants, and API keys created in the 24 hours after compromise.
4. **Contain and harden.** Enforce MFA everywhere and block legacy/basic authentication; stuffing dies against phishing-resistant MFA. Asset layer: Authentication on all clients, TLS in transit, authorization per queue/topic, quotas on producers. Environment layer: Federated identity across clouds from one IdP; consistent tagging and logging standards per cloud.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Blocking single IPs is whack-a-mole against botnets; block on behavior (velocity, fingerprint) rather than address.
- Forcing a fleet-wide password reset without confirming which accounts were actually taken over burns goodwill and teaches users to pick weaker passwords.
