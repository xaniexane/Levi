# Log Tampering Defense for IDS/IPS Sensors in Branch Offices (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers clear or alter logs to blind defenders — event log clears, audit policy disabling, or timestomping. The tampering itself is evidence: treat cleared logs as confirmation of malicious activity, not as missing data. Applies to IDS/IPS Sensors in Branch Offices at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- Event 1102 (audit log cleared) or 104 (log cleared), audit policy changes disabling categories, or gaps in otherwise continuous log streams.
- Timestomped files (MFT timestamps inconsistent with sequence numbers) or syslog gaps from specific hosts.
- SIEM agent uninstalls or forwarding configuration changes.
- Lens: Best telemetry: alert logs with full packet captures for high-severity events + sensor health metrics. SD-WAN/branch firewall logs forwarded centrally; local DHCP/DNS logs for device attribution.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NAC or port-level logs identifying which device was on which port during the incident.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Signature alert logs with triggering packet payloads; anomaly-detection baselines and deviations and PCAP ring buffers for incident windows; sensor placement/coverage maps; run `# Suricata/Snort style triage:` then `jq -c 'select(.alert.severity<=2) | {ts:.timestamp, sig:.alert.signature, src:.src_ip, dst:.dest_ip}' /var/log/suricata/eve.json | tail -20`.
3. **Analyze.** The clear event's timestamp bounds the attacker's active window — focus forensic effort just before it. Then: Recover from redundant sources: EDR cloud telemetry, network logs, and central syslog often survive local clears.
4. **Contain and harden.** Forward logs off-host in real time to tamper-evident central storage; alert on 1102/104 immediately. Asset layer: Sensors on SPAN/TAP at every trust boundary; signature sets auto-updated; TLS inspection feeding sensors. Environment layer: Standardized branch firewall policy deployed as code; no local admin exceptions.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Treating 'no logs' as 'no evidence of compromise' — absence after tampering IS the evidence.
- Relying solely on host logs; always have an independent telemetry path (network, EDR cloud).
