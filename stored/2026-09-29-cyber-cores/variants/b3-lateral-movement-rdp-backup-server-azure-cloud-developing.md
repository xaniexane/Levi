# RDP Lateral Movement Defense for Backup Servers in Azure Cloud (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

RDP is both an admin tool and the attacker's favorite lateral highway. Compromised credentials plus unrestricted RDP equals domain-wide movement that looks almost legitimate in the logs. Applies to Backup Servers in Azure Cloud at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- 4624 type-10 (RDP) logons from a workstation to servers or other workstations outside the user's normal admin pattern.
- RDP sessions at unusual hours, from hosts the account never logged into before, or with clipboard/drive redirection moving tools onto the target.
- TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager events (21/25) on targets without a matching helpdesk ticket or change record.
- Lens: Best telemetry: job audit logs + admin-console access logs + integrity-check results. Activity Log and Entra sign-in/audit logs streamed to Log Analytics/SIEM; Defender for Cloud alerts.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NSG flow logs and storage analytics for data-plane visibility.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Backup job definitions, run histories, and deletion/retention-change audit entries and Admin console logons and configuration exports; repository credential-change history; run `# conceptually (product CLIs differ):` then `backup-cli jobs list --failed --last 7d`.
3. **Analyze.** Correlate RDP logons with the source host's compromise timeline to distinguish attacker sessions from legitimate admin work. Then: Check for credential harvesting on each RDP target: LSASS access or SAM reads following the session indicate theft.
4. **Contain and harden.** RDP restricted to jump hosts/bastions with MFA; Network Level Authentication enforced; no direct workstation-to-server RDP. Asset layer: Immutable storage, separate admin credentials with MFA, no domain-joined backup console if avoidable. Environment layer: Azure Policy deny-effects on risky configurations; PIM-gated subscription roles.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Allowing 'temporary' RDP exceptions that become permanent lateral paths.
- Missing RDP-based movement because you only hunted SMB — attackers use whatever is open.
