# Business Email Compromise Defense for Network Switches in Air-Gapped Networks (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers operate inside a compromised mailbox (or a lookalike domain) to redirect payments, harvest invoices, or pivot to executives. Dwell time is often weeks; the fraud, not the malware, is the payload. Applies to Network Switches in Air-Gapped Networks at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- Mailbox audit logs show inbox rules created to move or delete messages containing 'invoice', 'payment', 'wire', or executive names — the classic BEC rule footprint.
- Outbound messages to finance vendors from a slightly altered domain, or a legitimate mailbox suddenly sending payment-change requests with urgent tone.
- Logons to the mailbox from foreign IPs or anonymizing VPNs followed by long read-only sessions (the attacker learning the payment workflow before striking).
- Lens: Best telemetry: syslog (port up/down, STP changes, config changes) + SNMP/NetFlow + NAC logs. Local SIEM/log collector inside the enclave (no cloud shipping); removable-media transfer logs.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Strict allowlisting logs: every binary execution recorded, since the set is small and known.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Syslog: link-state changes, MAC flaps, STP topology changes, login attempts and MAC address tables and ARP tables for device-to-port mapping during incidents; run `show mac address-table | include <suspect-mac>` then `show logging | include %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP|%PORT_SECURITY`.
3. **Analyze.** Export all inbox/transport rules for the affected mailbox and diff against a known-good baseline; BEC rules often hide with names like ';' or whitespace. Then: Trace every payment instruction the mailbox sent in the dwell window: which were acted on, which bank details changed, and whether funds are recallable.
4. **Contain and harden.** Require out-of-band (voice/video) verification for any payment detail change, no exceptions, and alert on new inbox rules fleet-wide. Asset layer: Port security / 802.1X on access ports, BPDU guard, DHCP snooping + dynamic ARP inspection. Environment layer: Data diodes or strictly controlled one-way transfers; media sanitization procedures for anything crossing.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Focusing only on the compromised mailbox while the attacker already harvested the vendor's thread and will re-target from another account.
- Treating a lookalike-domain BEC as an IT problem alone — finance process change is the actual fix.
