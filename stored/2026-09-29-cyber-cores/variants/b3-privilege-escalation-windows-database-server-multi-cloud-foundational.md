# Windows Privilege Escalation Defense for Database Servers in Multi-Cloud (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

From standard user to SYSTEM/Administrator via unquoted service paths, writable service binaries, AlwaysInstallElevated, token manipulation, or kernel exploits. Windows privesc is usually a misconfiguration the attacker read, not a zero-day they brought. Applies to Database Servers in Multi-Cloud at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- Service creation or modification events (7045/4697) pointing at user-writable paths, or processes spawning as SYSTEM from unexpected parents.
- Registry writes to AlwaysInstallElevated keys, accessibility binary replacement (sethc/utilman), or token duplication API patterns in EDR telemetry.
- Enumeration tooling: whoami /priv, accesschk, or PowerShell privesc scripts running before the escalation.
- Lens: Best telemetry: query audit logs (who ran what) + auth logs + backup/restore history. Cloud-agnostic SIEM normalizing AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Log, and GCP Audit Logs into one schema.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to CSPM coverage across all clouds with consistent misconfiguration alerting.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Database audit log: logons, privileged statements (DCL/DDL), and bulk-export queries and Slow/general query logs around the incident window; new users, roles, or linked servers; run `-- PostgreSQL style:` then `SELECT usename, query, query_start FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state='active' ORDER BY query_start;`.
3. **Analyze.** Pin down the primitive: unquoted path, weak service ACL, scheduled task with stored creds, or kernel CVE — then check how many fleet hosts share it. Then: Review what the elevated access touched: SAM/LSASS access after escalation means credential theft followed.
4. **Contain and harden.** Fix service ACLs and paths fleet-wide, disable AlwaysInstallElevated, and enforce signed-driver and LSA protection policies. Asset layer: Least-privilege DB roles, no app superusers, encrypted connections, auditing on privileged actions. Environment layer: Federated identity across clouds from one IdP; consistent tagging and logging standards per cloud.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Reimaging one host while the GPO-deployed misconfiguration recreates the hole on every rebuild.
- Missing that the attacker already dumped credentials post-escalation — scope the follow-on theft, not just the privesc.
