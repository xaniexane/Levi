# WMI Persistence Defense for Windows Workstations in GCP Cloud (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

WMI event subscriptions trigger payloads on system events (timers, logons) with no visible scheduled task or service. They are fileless, stealthy, and missed by autorun tools that do not enumerate the WMI repository. Applies to Windows Workstations in GCP Cloud at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- New __EventFilter/__EventConsumer/__FilterToConsumerBinding instances in the WMI repository, especially ActiveScript or CommandLine consumers with encoded commands.
- WmiPrvSE.exe spawning powershell/cmd at odd times, or WMI operational log entries for subscription creation.
- Persistence that survives task/service cleanup — the classic sign the mechanism is WMI-based.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Sysmon + EDR + PowerShell script-block logging forwarded to the SIEM. Cloud Audit Logs (admin + data access) exported to a locked-down logging project.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Security Command Center findings and VPC flow logs centralized.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Security event log (4624/4625 logons, 4688 process creation, 7045 service installs) and Sysmon operational log and PowerShell operational log (4104 script blocks); run `Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; Id=4625} -MaxEvents 50 | Format-List TimeCreated, @{n='TargetUser';e={$_.Properties[5].Value}}, @{n='SourceIP';e={$_.Properties[19].Value}}` then `autorunsc64.exe -accepteula -a * -c -h -s -t | findstr /v "Microsoft Corporation"`.
3. **Analyze.** Enumerate all event subscriptions (Get-WMIObject -Namespace root\subscription) and inspect each consumer's command line. Then: Correlate subscription creation time with the initial compromise to confirm it is attacker-planted, not admin tooling.
4. **Contain and harden.** Alert on WMI subscription creation events; restrict WMI namespace permissions to administrators. Asset layer: Application allowlisting (WDAC/AppLocker) and LSA Protection + Credential Guard enabled. Environment layer: Organization policies constraining public exposure, API enablement, and service-account key creation.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Declaring a host clean after checking tasks/services/registry but never looking at WMI subscriptions.
- Removing the consumer but leaving the filter and binding, which error silently and get recreated by the implant.
