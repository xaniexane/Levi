# Malicious PowerShell Abuse Defense for OT Controllers in Branch Offices (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

PowerShell is the attacker's Swiss-army knife: encoded commands, in-memory execution, credential theft, lateral movement. Deep script-block and module logging turns it from a blind spot into one of your richest telemetry sources. Applies to OT Controllers in Branch Offices at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- Event 4104 (script block logging) with encoded commands (-enc/-e), Invoke-Mimikatz/Invoke-Shellcode patterns, or obfuscation (heavy string concatenation, char codes).
- PowerShell spawned by Office, browsers, or WMI with hidden window styles, or AMSI bypass patterns in the script text.
- Module logging showing credential-access or AD-enumeration cmdlets from non-admin workstations.
- Lens: Best telemetry: passive OT network monitoring + engineering-workstation logs + change-management records. SD-WAN/branch firewall logs forwarded centrally; local DHCP/DNS logs for device attribution.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NAC or port-level logs identifying which device was on which port during the incident.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in OT protocol logs (Modbus/DNP3/OPC) from passive taps — never active-scan OT networks and Engineering workstation access and project-file change logs; run `# PASSIVE ONLY on OT networks — no active scanning:` then `tshark -r /captures/ot-span.pcap -Y 'modbus' -T fields -e frame.time -e modbus.func_code 2>/dev/null | head -20`.
3. **Analyze.** Decode every obfuscated layer — the final script reveals the true objective (many 'downloaders' are actually ransomware staging). Then: Correlate the PowerShell session with its parent to find the delivery vector (macro, scheduled task, remote session).
4. **Contain and harden.** Enable script-block logging, module logging, and transcription fleet-wide; forward to the SIEM with alerting. Asset layer: Air-gap or data-diode segmentation from IT, unidirectional gateways, strict change control on logic. Environment layer: Standardized branch firewall policy deployed as code; no local admin exceptions.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Logging PowerShell without a SIEM pipeline to analyze it — 4104 events are high-volume and useless unsearched.
- Assuming -noprofile -w hidden is always malicious; admins use it too — baseline first.
