# Golden Ticket Attack Defense for Mobile Devices (MDM) in Hybrid Cloud (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Forged Kerberos TGTs using the stolen krbtgt hash grant unrestricted, long-lived domain access that survives password resets. Detection relies on ticket anomalies: impossible lifetimes, wrong encryption, or logons that bypass the DC. Applies to Mobile Devices (MDM) in Hybrid Cloud at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- TGTs with lifetimes far exceeding domain policy (e.g., 10 years), RC4-encrypted tickets in an AES-enforced domain, or tickets for accounts that never authenticated (no 4768).
- 4769 service-ticket requests referencing a TGT the DC never issued, or logons from hosts with no corresponding interactive session.
- The krbtgt account's own anomalous activity following a DCSync event.
- Lens: Best telemetry: MDM compliance/app inventory + mobile threat defense alerts + enrollment logs. Unified SIEM ingesting both on-prem syslog and cloud audit trails with identity correlation across both.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Conditional-access and network logs covering the interconnect (ExpressRoute/Direct Connect/VPN).

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in MDM device inventory: OS versions, jailbreak/root detections, installed app lists and Mobile threat defense alerts (malicious apps, network attacks, OS tampering); run `# conceptually (MDM APIs differ):` then `mdm-cli devices list --noncompliant --limit 30`.
3. **Analyze.** Confirm via ticket inspection (klist, network capture): lifetime, encryption type, and client name mismatches prove forgery. Then: Scope everything done under forged tickets — assume full domain compromise until proven otherwise.
4. **Contain and harden.** Rotate the krbtgt password TWICE (to invalidate both current and previous hash) after any suspected compromise. Asset layer: Enrollment required for corporate data, OS version minimums, jailbreak/root = automatic quarantine. Environment layer: Consistent identity (single IdP) across on-prem and cloud; no parallel credential stores.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Rotating krbtgt only once — the N-1 hash remains valid and the golden ticket still works.
- Treating it as an account incident instead of a domain-trust incident; the response scope is the whole forest.
