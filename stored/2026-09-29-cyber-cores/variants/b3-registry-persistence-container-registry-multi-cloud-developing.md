# Registry Persistence Defense for Container Registries in Multi-Cloud (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Run keys, services, Winlogon helpers, and COM hijacks give attackers reboot-surviving execution with minimal footprint. Baseline the autoruns on gold images; alert on deviations, not on the mechanism's existence. Applies to Container Registries in Multi-Cloud at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- Writes to Run/RunOnce keys, Winlogon Userinit/Shell values, or service ImagePath entries pointing at unusual binaries.
- Sysmon event 13 (registry value set) on autorun locations by non-installer processes, or new services with suspicious binaries.
- Autoruns deltas: new entries appearing between baseline scans on hosts with no software-change record.
- Lens: Best telemetry: push/pull audit logs + image-scan results + signature verification logs. Cloud-agnostic SIEM normalizing AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Log, and GCP Audit Logs into one schema.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to CSPM coverage across all clouds with consistent misconfiguration alerting.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Push/pull audit log (who pushed which tag/digest, who pulled it, from where) and Vulnerability scan results per image; signature (cosign/Notary) verification outcomes; run `reg audit log --since 7d --action push | head -30` then `reg scan results --image <image:tag> --severity high,critical`.
3. **Analyze.** Capture the referenced binary: hash, signature, and sandbox detonation to confirm malicious intent. Then: Check the same autorun locations across the fleet — registry persistence is often deployed identically to many hosts.
4. **Contain and harden.** Scheduled Autoruns/Sysmon baselining with alerting on new persistence entries; restrict registry write rights for standard users. Asset layer: Image signing required, immutable tags for releases, vulnerability gates blocking critical CVEs. Environment layer: Federated identity across clouds from one IdP; consistent tagging and logging standards per cloud.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Cleaning the registry value while the dropper that restores it still runs on a schedule.
- Overlooking user-hive (HKCU) persistence during a 'system-only' triage.
