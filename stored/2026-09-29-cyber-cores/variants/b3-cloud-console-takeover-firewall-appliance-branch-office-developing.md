# Cloud Console Takeover Defense for Firewall Appliances in Branch Offices (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Stolen cloud credentials used in the web console give attackers point-and-click infrastructure control. Console logons from unusual locations followed by IAM changes are the classic takeover sequence. Applies to Firewall Appliances in Branch Offices at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- CloudTrail/Entra sign-in logs showing console logons from new countries or anonymizing services for privileged users.
- IAM policy changes, new access keys, or new users created within minutes of the anomalous logon.
- Disabling of CloudTrail/logging or deletion of log data — the attacker covering tracks.
- Lens: Best telemetry: traffic/deny logs + admin audit log + config-change diffs shipped to SIEM. SD-WAN/branch firewall logs forwarded centrally; local DHCP/DNS logs for device attribution.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NAC or port-level logs identifying which device was on which port during the incident.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Traffic logs (allowed/denied with rule IDs), threat logs (IPS/AV verdicts), admin audit log and Configuration revisions and diffs; VPN session logs and authentication failures; run `# vendor CLIs differ; conceptually:` then `show log traffic query (source <suspect-ip>)             # Palo Alto style`.
3. **Analyze.** Reconstruct the full API call sequence after takeover: what was created, modified, exfiltrated, or destroyed. Then: Check for persistence: new IAM users, roles with trust policies pointing outward, or modified instance user-data.
4. **Contain and harden.** Phishing-resistant MFA on all console users, especially root/ break-glass; SCPs preventing logging disablement. Asset layer: Default-deny with documented rules, admin on dedicated interface with MFA, config backups versioned. Environment layer: Standardized branch firewall policy deployed as code; no local admin exceptions.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Rotating the compromised user's keys but missing the backdoor IAM role the attacker created.
- Trusting the account's own logs after the attacker had admin — verify against the immutable archive.
