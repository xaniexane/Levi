# Registry Persistence Defense for macOS Endpoints in Branch Offices (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Run keys, services, Winlogon helpers, and COM hijacks give attackers reboot-surviving execution with minimal footprint. Baseline the autoruns on gold images; alert on deviations, not on the mechanism's existence. Applies to macOS Endpoints in Branch Offices at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- Writes to Run/RunOnce keys, Winlogon Userinit/Shell values, or service ImagePath entries pointing at unusual binaries.
- Sysmon event 13 (registry value set) on autorun locations by non-installer processes, or new services with suspicious binaries.
- Autoruns deltas: new entries appearing between baseline scans on hosts with no software-change record.
- Lens: Best telemetry: unified log + EDR agent + Santa/Munki logs where deployed. SD-WAN/branch firewall logs forwarded centrally; local DHCP/DNS logs for device attribution.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NAC or port-level logs identifying which device was on which port during the incident.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Unified log (log show) for process execution and auth events; login items and LaunchAgents/LaunchDaemons plists and Quarantine attributes (xattr com.apple.quarantine) on downloads; Gatekeeper assessment history; run `log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "sshd"' --last 2h | tail -20` then `ls -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ /Library/LaunchDaemons/ /Library/LaunchAgents/ 2>/dev/null`.
3. **Analyze.** Capture the referenced binary: hash, signature, and sandbox detonation to confirm malicious intent. Then: Check the same autorun locations across the fleet — registry persistence is often deployed identically to many hosts.
4. **Contain and harden.** Scheduled Autoruns/Sysmon baselining with alerting on new persistence entries; restrict registry write rights for standard users. Asset layer: Gatekeeper + XProtect current, FileVault on, firewall on, and MDM-enforced configuration profiles. Environment layer: Standardized branch firewall policy deployed as code; no local admin exceptions.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Cleaning the registry value while the dropper that restores it still runs on a schedule.
- Overlooking user-hive (HKCU) persistence during a 'system-only' triage.
