# DNS Fast-Flux Defense for Wireless Controllers in Remote Workforce (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

Fast-flux networks rotate DNS answers across many compromised hosts every few minutes, making malicious infrastructure hard to takedown. Defenders detect the flux pattern itself: low TTLs, high answer churn, and geographically scattered A records. Applies to Wireless Controllers in Remote Workforce at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- DNS answers with TTLs under 300 seconds rotating across dozens of IPs in unrelated ASNs and countries for a single domain.
- Short-lived domains (registered days ago) resolving to residential or compromised-server IPs with no legitimate business relationship.
- Endpoint connections to flux domains correlating with malware detonations or phishing kit infrastructure.
- Lens: Best telemetry: client association/auth logs + rogue-AP detection + RADIUS accounting. EDR on every endpoint as the primary sensor (no corporate network tap for remote hosts).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to VPN/ZTNA access logs and SaaS/IdP sign-in logs as the network-visibility substitute.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Client association, authentication (EAP) and roaming logs with device MACs and Rogue AP / evil-twin detections and deauth-flood alerts from WIDS; run `# conceptually (vendor CLIs differ):` then `show wireless client summary | include <suspect-mac>`.
3. **Analyze.** Profile the flux: record TTL, unique IPs per hour, ASN/country spread, and name-server patterns to fingerprint the specific flux service or kit. Then: Pivot from the domain to find sibling infrastructure: shared name servers, registration patterns, and certificate overlaps.
4. **Contain and harden.** DNS response policy zones (RPZ) blocking confirmed flux domains, plus alerting on sub-300s TTL answers at the resolver. Asset layer: WPA3-Enterprise with EAP-TLS (certificates, not PSK); rogue-AP containment enabled. Environment layer: Zero-trust access: device compliance + MFA per application, not per network.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Blocking individual flux IPs — they churn in minutes; block the domain pattern and the detection logic instead.
- Confusing legitimate CDN behavior (low TTL, many IPs) with flux; require the ASN-scatter plus short-domain-age combination.
