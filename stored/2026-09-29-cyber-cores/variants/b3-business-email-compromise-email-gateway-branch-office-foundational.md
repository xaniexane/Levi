# Business Email Compromise Defense for Email Gateways in Branch Offices (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers operate inside a compromised mailbox (or a lookalike domain) to redirect payments, harvest invoices, or pivot to executives. Dwell time is often weeks; the fraud, not the malware, is the payload. Applies to Email Gateways in Branch Offices at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- Mailbox audit logs show inbox rules created to move or delete messages containing 'invoice', 'payment', 'wire', or executive names — the classic BEC rule footprint.
- Outbound messages to finance vendors from a slightly altered domain, or a legitimate mailbox suddenly sending payment-change requests with urgent tone.
- Logons to the mailbox from foreign IPs or anonymizing VPNs followed by long read-only sessions (the attacker learning the payment workflow before striking).
- Lens: Best telemetry: message-tracking logs + sandbox verdicts + URL-rewrite click logs. SD-WAN/branch firewall logs forwarded centrally; local DHCP/DNS logs for device attribution.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NAC or port-level logs identifying which device was on which port during the incident.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Message tracking (sender, recipients, subject hash, attachments, verdicts) for the campaign window and Sandbox detonation reports for attachments/URLs; quarantined message copies; run `# conceptually (gateway CLIs differ):` then `message-tracking --sender <suspect-domain> --last 7d`.
3. **Analyze.** Export all inbox/transport rules for the affected mailbox and diff against a known-good baseline; BEC rules often hide with names like ';' or whitespace. Then: Trace every payment instruction the mailbox sent in the dwell window: which were acted on, which bank details changed, and whether funds are recallable.
4. **Contain and harden.** Require out-of-band (voice/video) verification for any payment detail change, no exceptions, and alert on new inbox rules fleet-wide. Asset layer: Sandbox detonation for all attachments/links, DMARC p=reject on owned domains, banner external mail. Environment layer: Standardized branch firewall policy deployed as code; no local admin exceptions.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Focusing only on the compromised mailbox while the attacker already harvested the vendor's thread and will re-target from another account.
- Treating a lookalike-domain BEC as an IT problem alone — finance process change is the actual fix.
