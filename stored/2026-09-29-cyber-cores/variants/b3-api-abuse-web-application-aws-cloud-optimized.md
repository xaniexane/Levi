# Public API Abuse Defense for Web Applications in AWS Cloud (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Exposed APIs are probed for injection, broken auth, and excessive data exposure. API abuse looks like legitimate traffic at volume — detection needs API-aware logging (endpoint, parameters, auth context), not just web logs. Applies to Web Applications in AWS Cloud at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- High-rate 4xx/5xx sequences against API endpoints indicating fuzzing, or single clients enumerating object IDs sequentially.
- Authenticated API calls accessing other users' objects (BOLA/IDOR patterns) or returning bulk data far beyond normal use.
- Known attack strings (SQLi, SSTI payloads) in API parameters.
- Lens: Best telemetry: app audit logs (with authenticated identity) + WAF logs + structured access logs. Organization CloudTrail in all regions, GuardDuty, and VPC flow logs shipped to the security account.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to CloudWatch and workload logs centralized; S3 access logging on sensitive buckets.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Application audit log: who did what to which object, with session IDs and source IPs and WAF block logs and anomaly scores; web-server access/error logs around the incident; run `grep -E ' 4[0-9]{2} | 5[0-9]{2} ' /var/log/nginx/access.log | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -15` then `journalctl -u myapp --since '2 hours ago' | grep -iE 'error|unauthor|exception' | tail -30`.
3. **Analyze.** Replay the suspect API sessions to determine exactly which records were accessed — the breach scope is the data returned, not the requests made. Then: Check whether the abused endpoint lacks authorization checks versus a credentialed attacker using stolen tokens.
4. **Contain and harden.** Positive-security API gateway policies: schema validation, rate limits per client, and authorization checks on every object reference. Asset layer: Authorization checks on every object reference, output encoding, parameterized queries, secure session handling. Environment layer: SCPs as guardrails (deny leaving org, deny disabling logging, region restrictions).
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- WAF-only defense: most API abuse is semantically valid HTTP that no signature catches.
- Logging without the auth context — you cannot distinguish attack from customer without knowing WHO called.
