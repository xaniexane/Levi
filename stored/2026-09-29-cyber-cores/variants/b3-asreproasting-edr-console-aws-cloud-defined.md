# ASREPRoasting Defense for EDR Consoles in AWS Cloud (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Accounts with Kerberos pre-authentication disabled can have their AS-REP responses requested by anyone and cracked offline — no authentication needed at all. One misconfigured user account is enough. Applies to EDR Consoles in AWS Cloud at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- 4768 (TGT request) events where pre-authentication was not used, from external or unexpected hosts, for accounts flagged DONT_REQ_PREAUTH.
- Enumeration of such accounts (LDAP queries for userAccountControl flags) preceding the roast requests.
- Later logons with the cracked credentials from attacker hosts.
- Lens: Best telemetry: raw process/network telemetry + detection history + sensor health inventory. Organization CloudTrail in all regions, GuardDuty, and VPC flow logs shipped to the security account.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to CloudWatch and workload logs centralized; S3 access logging on sensitive buckets.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Full process trees with command lines, hashes, and network connections for suspect hosts and Detection and response action history (isolations, kills, quarantines); run `# conceptually (EDR APIs differ):` then `edr-cli hunt process --hostname <host> --since 24h --tree`.
3. **Analyze.** Enumerate all accounts with pre-auth disabled (the full roast-able population) — the fix is one checkbox per account, so find them all. Then: Check whether any of those accounts are privileged or service accounts; prioritize accordingly.
4. **Contain and harden.** Enable Kerberos pre-authentication on every account; audit for the flag regularly — it gets re-disabled by legacy app troubleshooting. Asset layer: Tamper protection locked with console-only disable, auto-isolation policies for high-severity detections. Environment layer: SCPs as guardrails (deny leaving org, deny disabling logging, region restrictions).
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Fixing the roasted account but not scanning for the other 40 accounts with the same misconfiguration.
- Assuming pre-auth-disabled accounts are always legacy — verify before re-enabling to avoid breaking production auth.

## References

- MITRE ATT&CK: T1558.004 (Credential Access: AS-REP Roasting)
- Vendor logging and hardening baselines for EDR Consoles; SCPs as guardrails (deny leaving org, deny disabling logging, region restrictions).
