# Public API Abuse Defense for Code Repositories in Air-Gapped Networks (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Exposed APIs are probed for injection, broken auth, and excessive data exposure. API abuse looks like legitimate traffic at volume — detection needs API-aware logging (endpoint, parameters, auth context), not just web logs. Applies to Code Repositories in Air-Gapped Networks at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- High-rate 4xx/5xx sequences against API endpoints indicating fuzzing, or single clients enumerating object IDs sequentially.
- Authenticated API calls accessing other users' objects (BOLA/IDOR patterns) or returning bulk data far beyond normal use.
- Known attack strings (SQLi, SSTI payloads) in API parameters.
- Lens: Best telemetry: push/audit logs + secret-scanning alerts + branch-protection change history. Local SIEM/log collector inside the enclave (no cloud shipping); removable-media transfer logs.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Strict allowlisting logs: every binary execution recorded, since the set is small and known.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Push logs (who pushed what to which branch), force-push and history-rewrite records and Secret-scanning and code-scanning alerts with their resolution state; run `git log --since='7 days ago' --format='%h %an %ad %s' --date=short | head -30` then `git log --all --diff-filter=A -- '*secret*' '*credential*' '*key*' --format='%h %an %s' | head -20`.
3. **Analyze.** Replay the suspect API sessions to determine exactly which records were accessed — the breach scope is the data returned, not the requests made. Then: Check whether the abused endpoint lacks authorization checks versus a credentialed attacker using stolen tokens.
4. **Contain and harden.** Positive-security API gateway policies: schema validation, rate limits per client, and authorization checks on every object reference. Asset layer: Branch protection with required reviews, signed commits, push protection for secrets. Environment layer: Data diodes or strictly controlled one-way transfers; media sanitization procedures for anything crossing.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- WAF-only defense: most API abuse is semantically valid HTTP that no signature catches.
- Logging without the auth context — you cannot distinguish attack from customer without knowing WHO called.
