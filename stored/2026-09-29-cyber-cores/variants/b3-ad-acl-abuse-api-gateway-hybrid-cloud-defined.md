# Active Directory ACL Abuse Defense for API Gateways in Hybrid Cloud (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers abuse delegated Active Directory permissions — WriteDacl, GenericAll, ForceChangePassword — to escalate without exploits. These are legitimate rights granted too broadly, so detection means auditing WHO can do WHAT, continuously. Applies to API Gateways in Hybrid Cloud at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- 4662 events showing writes to security descriptors (WriteDacl / WriteOwner) on privileged groups, OUs, or the AdminSDHolder container.
- Password resets (4724) performed by non-helpdesk accounts, or new ACEs granting GenericAll over high-value targets.
- BloodHound-style LDAP enumeration (large object reads) preceding the ACL change — the attacker mapping attack paths.
- Lens: Best telemetry: per-request logs with API key/identity, endpoint, params hash, and response size. Unified SIEM ingesting both on-prem syslog and cloud audit trails with identity correlation across both.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Conditional-access and network logs covering the interconnect (ExpressRoute/Direct Connect/VPN).

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Gateway access logs with authenticated identity per call; rate-limit trigger logs and Schema-validation failure logs (attacks often start as malformed requests); run `grep <api-key-id> /var/log/apigw/access.log | awk '{print $7}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20` then `grep -c 'schema_validation_failed' /var/log/apigw/error.log`.
3. **Analyze.** Diff the object's ACL before and after: which principal gained which right, and was it granted through nested group membership? Then: Map the attack path the new right enables (e.g., GenericAll on a group -> add self -> Domain Admin) to scope the blast radius.
4. **Contain and harden.** Least-privilege delegation: no GenericAll/WriteDacl outside Domain Admins; regular ACL audits with alerting on changes to protected objects. Asset layer: Positive-security policies: schema validation, per-client rate limits, OAuth scopes per endpoint. Environment layer: Consistent identity (single IdP) across on-prem and cloud; no parallel credential stores.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- One-time ACL cleanup without continuous monitoring — delegation sprawl regrows within months.
- Forgetting nested groups: the dangerous ACE is often three group-nestings away from the attacker.
