# Group Policy Abuse Defense for DNS Servers in GCP Cloud (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Group Policy deploys to every machine in scope — including attacker-planted scheduled tasks, scripts, and software. A malicious GPO is a domain-wide persistence and execution platform; monitor GPO changes like code deployments. Applies to DNS Servers in GCP Cloud at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- 5136/5137 directory-service changes creating or modifying GPOs, especially new immediate scheduled tasks, startup scripts, or software installation policies.
- SYSVOL replication of unexpected scripts/executables, or GPO version number jumps without a change ticket.
- Mass host behavior change correlating with GP refresh cycles (new persistence appearing fleet-wide simultaneously).
- Lens: Best telemetry: query logs (or passive DNS) + zone-transfer/change audit + resolver cache stats. Cloud Audit Logs (admin + data access) exported to a locked-down logging project.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Security Command Center findings and VPC flow logs centralized.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in DNS query logs showing tunneling/DGA patterns; zone files and their change history and Zone-transfer (AXFR) request logs; DNSSEC validation failure logs; run `grep -E '.{60,}' /var/log/named/query.log | tail -20   # long labels: tunneling/DGA` then `rndc status; echo ---; journalctl -u named --since '1 hour ago' | grep -iE 'transfer|denied|error' | tail -15`.
3. **Analyze.** Inspect the GPO's full settings and linked scripts; determine the deployment scope (which OUs) to size the affected fleet. Then: Check GPO backup/version history to find when the malicious change was introduced and by whom.
4. **Contain and harden.** Restrict GPO edit rights to a break-glass group, require change tickets, and alert on any GPO modification in real time. Asset layer: Restrict recursion to internal clients, block outbound port 53 except resolvers, DNSSEC validation on. Environment layer: Organization policies constraining public exposure, API enablement, and service-account key creation.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Deleting the malicious GPO without removing the persistence it already deployed to thousands of hosts.
- Missing GPO-based deployment because you hunted only local persistence mechanisms.
