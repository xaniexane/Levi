# Supply Chain Compromise Defense for Microsoft Entra ID Tenants in Multi-Cloud (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Trusted software updates or vendor components carry the attacker's payload — the hardest vector to prevent, because the malware arrives signed and expected. Defense shifts to verification, segmentation, and vendor scrutiny. Applies to Microsoft Entra ID Tenants in Multi-Cloud at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- A signed, trusted application suddenly exhibiting C2 communication or spawning unexpected children after an update.
- Threat intel or vendor advisory naming a specific product version as compromised.
- Anomalous behavior correlated tightly with a software update timestamp across many hosts.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Entra sign-in + audit logs streamed to Log Analytics/SIEM with 30+ day retention. Cloud-agnostic SIEM normalizing AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Log, and GCP Audit Logs into one schema.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to CSPM coverage across all clouds with consistent misconfiguration alerting.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Sign-in logs (interactive, non-interactive, service principal) with risk detections and MFA details and Audit logs: app registrations, consent grants, Conditional Access changes, role assignments; run `# Microsoft Graph (delegated admin): recent risky sign-ins` then `Get-MgAuditLogSignIn -Filter "riskState eq 'atRisk'" -Top 25 | Select-Object CreatedDateTime, UserPrincipalName, IpAddress, @{n='Risk';e={$_.RiskDetail}}`.
3. **Analyze.** Identify the trojanized version and enumerate every host that installed it — the exposure list defines the response scope. Then: Determine what the implanted component could access (its privilege level and data reach) to bound the impact.
4. **Contain and harden.** Software allowlisting with version pinning; staged update rollouts with behavioral monitoring before fleet-wide deploy. Asset layer: Conditional Access: require phishing-resistant MFA, compliant devices, block legacy auth and risky sign-ins. Environment layer: Federated identity across clouds from one IdP; consistent tagging and logging standards per cloud.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Assuming signed = safe; supply-chain malware is signed by definition.
- Delaying response waiting for the vendor's statement while the implant remains active.
