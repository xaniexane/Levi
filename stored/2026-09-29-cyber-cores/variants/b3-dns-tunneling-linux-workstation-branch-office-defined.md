# DNS Tunneling Defense for Linux Workstations in Branch Offices (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

DNS tunneling smuggles data or C2 inside DNS queries, abusing a protocol almost every network allows outbound. Detection hinges on query shape (length, entropy, volume, record types), not on blocklists. Applies to Linux Workstations in Branch Offices at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- Long, high-entropy subdomains (often 50+ chars) in DNS logs, unusual record types (TXT, NULL) at volume, or a single host generating thousands of queries to one domain.
- Beacon-like regularity in query timing to an obscure domain, or DNS queries for domains registered within the last 30 days.
- Responses with abnormally large TXT records relative to the query — data coming back down the tunnel.
- Lens: Best telemetry: auditd user-session logging + EDR agent + desktop shell histories (with user notice). SD-WAN/branch firewall logs forwarded centrally; local DHCP/DNS logs for device attribution.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NAC or port-level logs identifying which device was on which port during the incident.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in User shell histories (~/.bash_history), desktop autostart entries (~/.config/autostart/) and auditd execve logs and USB device logs; browser profiles for web-vector cases; run `ls -la ~/.config/autostart/ 2>/dev/null; grep -r 'Exec=' ~/.config/autostart/ 2>/dev/null` then `sudo ausearch --start recent -m EXECVE -i | tail -30`.
3. **Analyze.** Decode a sample of tunneled queries/responses in a sandbox to determine direction and content: C2 instructions, exfiltrated data, or both. Then: Identify patient zero by earliest query timestamp, then hunt laterally: tunneling tools are often deployed to multiple hosts.
4. **Contain and harden.** Force all DNS through logged, filtered resolvers; block direct port-53 egress from endpoints and alert on non-standard DNS ports. Asset layer: Standard user accounts for daily work, full-disk encryption, and screen-lock enforcement. Environment layer: Standardized branch firewall policy deployed as code; no local admin exceptions.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Blocking the domain without finding the implant — the attacker rotates domains faster than you blocklist.
- Ignoring DNS over HTTPS (DoH): tunneled traffic inside DoH is invisible to passive DNS monitoring — log at the endpoint.
