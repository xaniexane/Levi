# Pass-the-Hash Defense for File Servers in Azure Cloud (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Stolen NTLM hashes authenticate without the password ever being cracked. It is invisible to password monitoring because no password is used — defense means killing NTLM where possible and watching for its telltale logon patterns. Applies to File Servers in Azure Cloud at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- 4624 type-3/9 logons using NTLM where Kerberos is expected, especially from workstations to servers with admin accounts.
- Logon sessions with no interactive activity but successful authentication, or the same hash authenticating from multiple hosts simultaneously.
- NTLM audit logs showing authentication for accounts that should be Kerberos-only.
- Lens: Best telemetry: object-access auditing (who opened/modified what) + share-permission reviews. Activity Log and Entra sign-in/audit logs streamed to Log Analytics/SIEM; Defender for Cloud alerts.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NSG flow logs and storage analytics for data-plane visibility.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in File-access audit events (4663/4656 on Windows; auditd on Linux) for sensitive shares and Share and NTFS/ACL permission exports; recent permission-change events; run `Get-SmbShare | Select-Object Name, Path, Description; echo ---; Get-SmbShareAccess -Name <share>` then `Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; Id=4663} -MaxEvents 100 | Group-Object {$_.Properties[1].Value} | Sort-Object Count -Descending | Select-Object -First 10 Name, Count`.
3. **Analyze.** Determine hash source: LSASS dump, SAM extraction, or DCSync — each implies a different prior compromise to remediate. Then: List every host the hash authenticated to; each is a foothold until reimaged or verified clean.
4. **Contain and harden.** Reduce NTLM usage (audit mode first, then restrict), deploy Credential Guard, and use unique local admin passwords (LAPS). Asset layer: Access-based enumeration, least-privilege share/NTFS rights, no Everyone:Full Control anywhere. Environment layer: Azure Policy deny-effects on risky configurations; PIM-gated subscription roles.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Resetting the password without considering that the attacker may have dumped the NEW hash too if still present.
- Disabling NTLM blindly and breaking legacy apps — audit first, restrict second.
