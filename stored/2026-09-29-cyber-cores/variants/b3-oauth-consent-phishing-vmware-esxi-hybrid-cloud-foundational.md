# OAuth Consent Phishing Defense for VMware ESXi Hosts in Hybrid Cloud (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

Users grant a malicious app OAuth permissions, giving the attacker persistent API access to mailbox, files, or directory — no password needed, survives password resets, invisible in logon logs. Applies to VMware ESXi Hosts in Hybrid Cloud at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- New enterprise app registrations or OAuth consent grants for apps with vague names, especially requesting Mail.Read or Files.ReadWrite.All.
- Consent grants by users outside any change process, or apps verified by unknown publishers.
- API-driven mailbox/file access patterns (Graph API) with no corresponding interactive logon.
- Lens: Best telemetry: vCenter tasks/events + ESXi syslog + lockdown-mode audit. Unified SIEM ingesting both on-prem syslog and cloud audit trails with identity correlation across both.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Conditional-access and network logs covering the interconnect (ExpressRoute/Direct Connect/VPN).

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in vCenter tasks and events (VM power ops, snapshot create/delete, host profile changes) and ESXi hostd/vpxa logs and shell-access records; VM .vmx changes; run `esxcli system auditrecords local list | tail -20` then `vim-cmd vmsvc/getallvms 2>/dev/null | head -20`.
3. **Analyze.** Inventory every permission the malicious app holds and every API call it made — the data accessed defines the breach. Then: Check for admin-consent abuse: was the app granted tenant-wide access by a compromised admin?
4. **Contain and harden.** Require admin consent for third-party apps; maintain an allowlist of approved publishers. Asset layer: Lockdown mode on, isolated management network, unique per-host root passwords, MFA on vCenter. Environment layer: Consistent identity (single IdP) across on-prem and cloud; no parallel credential stores.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Resetting the user's password and declaring victory while the OAuth grant keeps working.
- Overlooking that the app may have been granted access by an ADMIN — scope tenant-wide, not per-user.
