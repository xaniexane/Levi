# SMB Lateral Movement Defense for Mobile Devices (MDM) in On-Premises Datacenter (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers move host-to-host over SMB using stolen credentials — PsExec-style service creation, admin shares, or WMI. In a flat network, one compromised workstation becomes the whole domain in hours. Applies to Mobile Devices (MDM) in On-Premises Datacenter at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- SMB sessions from a workstation to many other hosts in a short window, especially to ADMIN$ or C$ shares the user never touches normally.
- Service creation events (7045) with service binaries in ADMIN$\system32, or 4624 type-3 logons with the same account across dozens of hosts.
- EDR process trees showing services.exe spawning cmd/powershell shortly after a remote SMB session.
- Lens: Best telemetry: MDM compliance/app inventory + mobile threat defense alerts + enrollment logs. Full network tap/SPAN coverage at core and distribution layers feeding IDS and full-packet capture.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Centralized syslog from all infrastructure with NTP-synced timestamps for cross-device correlation.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in MDM device inventory: OS versions, jailbreak/root detections, installed app lists and Mobile threat defense alerts (malicious apps, network attacks, OS tampering); run `# conceptually (MDM APIs differ):` then `mdm-cli devices list --noncompliant --limit 30`.
3. **Analyze.** Map the movement graph: source host, credential used, target hosts, timestamps — this is the incident's skeleton. Then: Determine which credential enabled it (stolen hash, ticket, or plaintext) to know what must be rotated enterprise-wide.
4. **Contain and harden.** Segment the network (workstation-to-workstation SMB blocked), deploy LAPS for unique local admin passwords, and restrict lateral logon rights via tiered admin model. Asset layer: Enrollment required for corporate data, OS version minimums, jailbreak/root = automatic quarantine. Environment layer: Physical access controls with badge logs correlatable to logical access during investigations.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Cleaning patient zero while the attacker's beachheads on hosts 3, 7, and 12 remain active.
- Rotating the compromised account's password but not the kerberos tickets/hashes already stolen from it.
