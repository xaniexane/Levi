# RDP Lateral Movement Defense for Kubernetes Clusters in Air-Gapped Networks (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

RDP is both an admin tool and the attacker's favorite lateral highway. Compromised credentials plus unrestricted RDP equals domain-wide movement that looks almost legitimate in the logs. Applies to Kubernetes Clusters in Air-Gapped Networks at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- 4624 type-10 (RDP) logons from a workstation to servers or other workstations outside the user's normal admin pattern.
- RDP sessions at unusual hours, from hosts the account never logged into before, or with clipboard/drive redirection moving tools onto the target.
- TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager events (21/25) on targets without a matching helpdesk ticket or change record.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Kubernetes audit logs + container runtime logs + admission-controller denials. Local SIEM/log collector inside the enclave (no cloud shipping); removable-media transfer logs.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Strict allowlisting logs: every binary execution recorded, since the set is small and known.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in API-server audit log (who created pods/bindings/secrets, from where) and Kubelet/container runtime logs and image pull histories per node; run `kubectl audit2rbac --filename=audit.log 2>/dev/null | head; kubectl get clusterrolebindings -o wide | head -20` then `kubectl get pods -A -o json | python3 -c "import json,sys; [print(p['metadata']['namespace'], p['metadata']['name'], p['spec'].get('hostNetwork'), p['spec'].get('hostPID')) for p in json.load(sys.stdin)['items']]" | head -30`.
3. **Analyze.** Correlate RDP logons with the source host's compromise timeline to distinguish attacker sessions from legitimate admin work. Then: Check for credential harvesting on each RDP target: LSASS access or SAM reads following the session indicate theft.
4. **Contain and harden.** RDP restricted to jump hosts/bastions with MFA; Network Level Authentication enforced; no direct workstation-to-server RDP. Asset layer: Least-privilege RBAC, Pod Security Standards enforced, no privileged pods, image signing/verification. Environment layer: Data diodes or strictly controlled one-way transfers; media sanitization procedures for anything crossing.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Allowing 'temporary' RDP exceptions that become permanent lateral paths.
- Missing RDP-based movement because you only hunted SMB — attackers use whatever is open.
