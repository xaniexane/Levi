# Ransomware Encryption Defense for Load Balancers in On-Premises Datacenter (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

Ransomware encrypts files and demands payment, usually after days of dwell time spent disabling recovery. Speed of isolation decides whether you lose one host or the fleet. Never pay without a deliberate, documented decision process. Applies to Load Balancers in On-Premises Datacenter at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- EDR fires on mass file rename/extension changes, vssadmin delete shadows, bcdedit recovery disabling, or known ransomware process names within seconds of each other.
- Ransom notes (README, DECRYPT files) appearing in multiple directories, wallpaper changes, or a sudden burst of encrypted file extensions across shares.
- Precursor activity in the prior 72 hours: disabled EDR tamper protection, cleared event logs, or backup job failures and backup-server logons from unusual accounts.
- Lens: Best telemetry: access logs with X-Forwarded-For + backend health flaps + config-change audit. Full network tap/SPAN coverage at core and distribution layers feeding IDS and full-packet capture.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Centralized syslog from all infrastructure with NTP-synced timestamps for cross-device correlation.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Access logs (client IP, Host header, URI, status, bytes) — the edge view of web attacks and Backend pool changes and health-check failure histories; run `grep -E ' 4[0-9]{2} ' /var/log/haproxy.log | awk '{print $6}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -15` then `echo 'show stat' | socat unix-connect:/var/run/haproxy.sock stdio 2>/dev/null | cut -d, -f1,2,18 | head -20`.
3. **Analyze.** Identify the variant from the note text, extension, and ransom portal; check public decryptor availability before any recovery decision — some variants have free decryptors. Then: Reconstruct the entry vector (phishing, exposed RDP/VPN, software vulnerability) and the dwell timeline: first access, privilege escalation, backup targeting, detonation.
4. **Contain and harden.** Immutable, offline-tested backups with alerting on backup tampering; network segmentation so one host cannot reach all shares. Asset layer: TLS 1.2+ with strong ciphers, HSTS, WAF integration at the edge, config changes via version control. Environment layer: Physical access controls with badge logs correlatable to logical access during investigations.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Rebuilding from backups that the attacker already found and poisoned — verify backup integrity and isolation first.
- Paying the ransom without confirming the decryptor works and without legal/regulatory review of sanctions exposure.
