# OAuth Consent Phishing Defense for Hyper-V Hosts in GCP Cloud (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

Users grant a malicious app OAuth permissions, giving the attacker persistent API access to mailbox, files, or directory — no password needed, survives password resets, invisible in logon logs. Applies to Hyper-V Hosts in GCP Cloud at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- New enterprise app registrations or OAuth consent grants for apps with vague names, especially requesting Mail.Read or Files.ReadWrite.All.
- Consent grants by users outside any change process, or apps verified by unknown publishers.
- API-driven mailbox/file access patterns (Graph API) with no corresponding interactive logon.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Hyper-V-VMMS/Hyper-V-Worker event logs + host Security log + SCVMM job history. Cloud Audit Logs (admin + data access) exported to a locked-down logging project.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Security Command Center findings and VPC flow logs centralized.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Microsoft-Windows-Hyper-V-VMMS event log (VM create/start/stop, checkpoint ops) and Virtual switch and virtual NIC configuration; VM configuration files and checkpoints; run `Get-WinEvent -LogName 'Microsoft-Windows-Hyper-V-VMMS-Admin' -MaxEvents 25 | Select-Object TimeCreated, Id, Message | Format-Table -Wrap` then `Get-VM | Select-Object Name, State, CheckpointType, @{n='Switch';e={(Get-VMNetworkAdapter $_).SwitchName}} | Format-Table`.
3. **Analyze.** Inventory every permission the malicious app holds and every API call it made — the data accessed defines the breach. Then: Check for admin-consent abuse: was the app granted tenant-wide access by a compromised admin?
4. **Contain and harden.** Require admin consent for third-party apps; maintain an allowlist of approved publishers. Asset layer: Dedicated management NIC/vLAN, Shielded VMs for sensitive workloads, guarded fabric where available. Environment layer: Organization policies constraining public exposure, API enablement, and service-account key creation.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Resetting the user's password and declaring victory while the OAuth grant keeps working.
- Overlooking that the app may have been granted access by an ADMIN — scope tenant-wide, not per-user.
