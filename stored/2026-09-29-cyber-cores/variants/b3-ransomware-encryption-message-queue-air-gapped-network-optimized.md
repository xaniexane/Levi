# Ransomware Encryption Defense for Message Queues in Air-Gapped Networks (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Ransomware encrypts files and demands payment, usually after days of dwell time spent disabling recovery. Speed of isolation decides whether you lose one host or the fleet. Never pay without a deliberate, documented decision process. Applies to Message Queues in Air-Gapped Networks at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- EDR fires on mass file rename/extension changes, vssadmin delete shadows, bcdedit recovery disabling, or known ransomware process names within seconds of each other.
- Ransom notes (README, DECRYPT files) appearing in multiple directories, wallpaper changes, or a sudden burst of encrypted file extensions across shares.
- Precursor activity in the prior 72 hours: disabled EDR tamper protection, cleared event logs, or backup job failures and backup-server logons from unusual accounts.
- Lens: Best telemetry: queue depth/lag metrics + producer/consumer auth logs + dead-letter queues. Local SIEM/log collector inside the enclave (no cloud shipping); removable-media transfer logs.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Strict allowlisting logs: every binary execution recorded, since the set is small and known.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Queue metrics: depth spikes, consumer lag, and poison-message dead-letter queues and Authentication logs for producers/consumers; new queue/topic creation events; run `rabbitmqctl list_queues name messages consumers 2>/dev/null | head -20` then `kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server <broker> --describe --all-groups 2>/dev/null | head -20`.
3. **Analyze.** Identify the variant from the note text, extension, and ransom portal; check public decryptor availability before any recovery decision — some variants have free decryptors. Then: Reconstruct the entry vector (phishing, exposed RDP/VPN, software vulnerability) and the dwell timeline: first access, privilege escalation, backup targeting, detonation.
4. **Contain and harden.** Immutable, offline-tested backups with alerting on backup tampering; network segmentation so one host cannot reach all shares. Asset layer: Authentication on all clients, TLS in transit, authorization per queue/topic, quotas on producers. Environment layer: Data diodes or strictly controlled one-way transfers; media sanitization procedures for anything crossing.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Rebuilding from backups that the attacker already found and poisoned — verify backup integrity and isolation first.
- Paying the ransom without confirming the decryptor works and without legal/regulatory review of sanctions exposure.
