# Drive-By Download Defense for SSO Identity Providers in Air-Gapped Networks (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Visiting a compromised or malicious page silently downloads malware via browser or plugin exploits. Patching and browser isolation remove the opportunity; proxy logs reveal the exposure. Applies to SSO Identity Providers in Air-Gapped Networks at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- Browser spawning unexpected child processes or writing executables to temp/downloads without user download action.
- Proxy logs showing visits to compromised sites followed by executable downloads, often via redirect chains.
- Exploit-kit patterns: rapid plugin version probing, obfuscated JavaScript, then payload fetch.
- Lens: Best telemetry: authentication logs with MFA detail + app-assignment changes + federation trust changes. Local SIEM/log collector inside the enclave (no cloud shipping); removable-media transfer logs.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Strict allowlisting logs: every binary execution recorded, since the set is small and known.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Authentication logs per application (success/failure, MFA method, device, location) and Application assignment and provisioning logs; new SSO integrations; run `# conceptually (IdP APIs differ):` then `idp-cli logs auth --user <upn> --last 7d --format table | head -25`.
3. **Analyze.** Reconstruct the redirect chain from proxy logs to identify the compromised page or malvertising source. Then: Determine whether the payload executed: browser process tree and EDR execution events after the download timestamp.
4. **Contain and harden.** Automatic browser and OS patching; remove or sandbox legacy plugins (Java, Flash-era); consider browser isolation for high-risk users. Asset layer: Phishing-resistant MFA default, sign-on policies per app risk, session lifetime limits. Environment layer: Data diodes or strictly controlled one-way transfers; media sanitization procedures for anything crossing.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Assuming the user 'must have clicked something' — drive-bys need no click, so user interviews mislead.
- Cleaning the endpoint without blocking the compromised site that will re-infect the next visitor.
