# Double-Extortion Ransomware Defense for GCP Projects in Air-Gapped Networks (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

Data is exfiltrated BEFORE encryption, so the attacker can leak it even if you restore from backups. The investigation must answer what was stolen, not just what was encrypted — breach notification clocks start on exfiltration. Applies to GCP Projects in Air-Gapped Networks at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- Large outbound transfers (tens of GB) to cloud storage, file shares, or anonymized endpoints in the days before encryption, often via rclone, MEGAsync, or custom tooling.
- Staging directories with archived/renamed sensitive data (databases, file shares zipped) and data-leak-site monitoring hits for your organization name.
- The ransom note references specific stolen files or threatens publication with a countdown timer.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Cloud Audit Logs (Admin Activity + Data Access) + Security Command Center + VPC flow logs. Local SIEM/log collector inside the enclave (no cloud shipping); removable-media transfer logs.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Strict allowlisting logs: every binary execution recorded, since the set is small and known.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Cloud Audit Logs: setIamPolicy, storage.setIamPermissions, compute inserts, and console logons and Security Command Center findings; Forseti/Config Validator drift reports where deployed; run `gcloud logging read 'protoPayload.methodName:"SetIamPolicy"' --limit 20 --format='table(timestamp, protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail, resourceName)'` then `gcloud scc findings list organizations/$ORG_ID --filter='state="ACTIVE"' --limit 15`.
3. **Analyze.** Quantify the exfil: source directories, file types, record counts, and whether regulated data (PII, PHI, card data) was included — this drives notification obligations. Then: Preserve exfiltration logs (proxy, firewall, DLP, cloud audit) as evidence; they are also the proof of what did and did not leave.
4. **Contain and harden.** DLP egress policies on sensitive data stores plus alerting on bulk archive creation and large outbound transfers. Asset layer: Organization policies: no public buckets, no default SA use, OS Login on; deny unapproved APIs. Environment layer: Data diodes or strictly controlled one-way transfers; media sanitization procedures for anything crossing.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Declaring victory after restoring from backup while stolen data sits on a leak site — the extortion continues.
- Starting the notification clock at encryption time instead of at first confirmed exfiltration.
