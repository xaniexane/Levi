# Container Escape Defense for Azure Subscriptions in Air-Gapped Networks (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

A compromised container breaks out to the host via privileged mode, hostPath mounts, or kernel exploits — turning one application breach into full node control. Harden the container boundary and monitor for escape primitives. Applies to Azure Subscriptions in Air-Gapped Networks at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- Containers running privileged or with hostPath mounts to sensitive host paths, especially created outside normal deployments.
- Host-level processes spawned by container runtimes, or unexpected writes to host paths from container contexts.
- Kernel exploit artifacts or abuse of host namespaces (nsenter-style) inside container workloads.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Activity Log + Entra sign-in logs + Defender for Cloud + NSG flow logs. Local SIEM/log collector inside the enclave (no cloud shipping); removable-media transfer logs.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Strict allowlisting logs: every binary execution recorded, since the set is small and known.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Azure Activity Log (write/delete on IAM, policy, network) and Entra audit/sign-in logs and Defender for Cloud recommendations and alerts; resource-change history; run `az monitor activity-log list --max-events 25 --query '[].{time:eventTimestamp, op:operationName.value, caller:caller}' -o table` then `az security alert list --query '[].{name:alertDisplayName, severity:severity, time:timeGeneratedUtc}' -o table`.
3. **Analyze.** Determine the escape primitive: misconfiguration (privileged, hostPath, hostPID) versus kernel CVE — the fix differs. Then: Assess node compromise: if escaped, the node is hostile — cordon, drain, and rebuild it; do not trust in-place cleaning.
4. **Contain and harden.** Never run privileged containers; drop capabilities, use read-only root filesystems, and enforce via admission controllers (OPA/Kyverno). Asset layer: Azure Policy deny-effects on public storage/exposure; PIM for subscription roles; Defender plans on. Environment layer: Data diodes or strictly controlled one-way transfers; media sanitization procedures for anything crossing.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Rebuilding the container while the compromised node keeps serving the attacker's workloads.
- Assuming non-privileged means safe — hostPath mounts and capabilities can be equally fatal.
