# DCSync Attack Defense for API Gateways in Multi-Cloud (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

With replication rights, an attacker impersonates a domain controller and pulls password hashes for ANY account — including krbtgt — via normal replication traffic. It looks like DC-to-DC chatter, which is why it evades naive monitoring. Applies to API Gateways in Multi-Cloud at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- 4662 (directory object access) on the domain root or krbtgt account by a principal that is not a real domain controller.
- Replication traffic (DRS) originating from a non-DC host, or a DC requesting replication far outside the normal schedule.
- Newly granted DS-Replication-Get-Changes rights (especially Get-Changes-All) to users, groups, or computers.
- Lens: Best telemetry: per-request logs with API key/identity, endpoint, params hash, and response size. Cloud-agnostic SIEM normalizing AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Log, and GCP Audit Logs into one schema.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to CSPM coverage across all clouds with consistent misconfiguration alerting.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Gateway access logs with authenticated identity per call; rate-limit trigger logs and Schema-validation failure logs (attacks often start as malformed requests); run `grep <api-key-id> /var/log/apigw/access.log | awk '{print $7}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20` then `grep -c 'schema_validation_failed' /var/log/apigw/error.log`.
3. **Analyze.** Identify which account performed the sync and which hashes were pulled — a krbtgt pull means the entire domain's Kerberos trust must be reset (double krbtgt rotation). Then: Review how the attacker gained replication rights: compromised admin, delegated rights sprawl, or ACL abuse.
4. **Contain and harden.** Audit and strip replication rights to the minimum; alert on any grant of Get-Changes-All. Asset layer: Positive-security policies: schema validation, per-client rate limits, OAuth scopes per endpoint. Environment layer: Federated identity across clouds from one IdP; consistent tagging and logging standards per cloud.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Resetting user passwords but not the krbtgt — golden tickets forged from a stolen krbtgt survive password resets.
- Missing that DCSync needs only replication rights, not Domain Admin — delegated-rights sprawl is the usual enabler.
