# DLL Hijacking Defense for Firewall Appliances in GCP Cloud (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Applications loading DLLs from insecure paths let attackers plant a malicious DLL that executes with the application's privileges. Detection focuses on DLL loads from writable directories and known-vulnerable applications. Applies to Firewall Appliances in GCP Cloud at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- Sysmon event 7 (image loaded) showing DLLs loaded from temp, downloads, or user-writable directories by privileged processes.
- New DLL files appearing alongside application executables, especially with names matching system DLLs.
- Application crashes or behavior changes after a DLL appears in its directory.
- Lens: Best telemetry: traffic/deny logs + admin audit log + config-change diffs shipped to SIEM. Cloud Audit Logs (admin + data access) exported to a locked-down logging project.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Security Command Center findings and VPC flow logs centralized.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Traffic logs (allowed/denied with rule IDs), threat logs (IPS/AV verdicts), admin audit log and Configuration revisions and diffs; VPN session logs and authentication failures; run `# vendor CLIs differ; conceptually:` then `show log traffic query (source <suspect-ip>)             # Palo Alto style`.
3. **Analyze.** Verify the loading order: confirm the planted DLL shadows a legitimate one via PATH or application-directory precedence. Then: Check the DLL's exports and behavior in a sandbox — many hijack DLLs proxy the original to stay stealthy.
4. **Contain and harden.** Applications should use absolute paths and SafeDllSearchMode; remove user-writable directories from the DLL search order. Asset layer: Default-deny with documented rules, admin on dedicated interface with MFA, config backups versioned. Environment layer: Organization policies constraining public exposure, API enablement, and service-account key creation.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Deleting the DLL without fixing the insecure load order — the hole remains for the next attacker.
- Assuming signed applications are immune; the signature covers the EXE, not the DLL it loads.
