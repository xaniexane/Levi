# Malicious PowerShell Abuse Defense for Proxy Servers in Air-Gapped Networks (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

PowerShell is the attacker's Swiss-army knife: encoded commands, in-memory execution, credential theft, lateral movement. Deep script-block and module logging turns it from a blind spot into one of your richest telemetry sources. Applies to Proxy Servers in Air-Gapped Networks at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- Event 4104 (script block logging) with encoded commands (-enc/-e), Invoke-Mimikatz/Invoke-Shellcode patterns, or obfuscation (heavy string concatenation, char codes).
- PowerShell spawned by Office, browsers, or WMI with hidden window styles, or AMSI bypass patterns in the script text.
- Module logging showing credential-access or AD-enumeration cmdlets from non-admin workstations.
- Lens: Best telemetry: full URL logs with user identity + TLS SNI logs + block/allow verdicts. Local SIEM/log collector inside the enclave (no cloud shipping); removable-media transfer logs.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Strict allowlisting logs: every binary execution recorded, since the set is small and known.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Access logs (user, URL, category, verdict, bytes) for the incident window and Blocked-request logs showing attempted C2/malware/phishing destinations; run `grep <username> /var/log/squid/access.log | awk '{print $7}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20` then `grep -E 'TCP_DENIED|BLOCK' /var/log/squid/access.log | tail -30`.
3. **Analyze.** Decode every obfuscated layer — the final script reveals the true objective (many 'downloaders' are actually ransomware staging). Then: Correlate the PowerShell session with its parent to find the delivery vector (macro, scheduled task, remote session).
4. **Contain and harden.** Enable script-block logging, module logging, and transcription fleet-wide; forward to the SIEM with alerting. Asset layer: Authenticated proxying (no anonymous egress), category blocking, TLS inspection where policy allows. Environment layer: Data diodes or strictly controlled one-way transfers; media sanitization procedures for anything crossing.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Logging PowerShell without a SIEM pipeline to analyze it — 4104 events are high-volume and useless unsearched.
- Assuming -noprofile -w hidden is always malicious; admins use it too — baseline first.
