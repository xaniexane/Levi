# Phishing Credential Harvest Defense for IDS/IPS Sensors in Branch Offices (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Users are lured to lookalike login pages (often via adversary-in-the-middle kits that relay MFA) and submit credentials. The defender's job: find who clicked, who submitted, and whether sessions were hijacked even where MFA appeared to hold. Applies to IDS/IPS Sensors in Branch Offices at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- Email gateway logs show a burst of messages with lookalike domains, newly registered domains, or QR-code lures pointing at a credential-harvest kit URL.
- Proxy/DNS logs show visits to the kit domain followed within minutes by logons from unusual IPs or impossible-travel pairs for the same user.
- AiTM kits leave telltales: logon session created without a matching MFA challenge event, or token replay from datacenter IP ranges.
- Lens: Best telemetry: alert logs with full packet captures for high-severity events + sensor health metrics. SD-WAN/branch firewall logs forwarded centrally; local DHCP/DNS logs for device attribution.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NAC or port-level logs identifying which device was on which port during the incident.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Signature alert logs with triggering packet payloads; anomaly-detection baselines and deviations and PCAP ring buffers for incident windows; sensor placement/coverage maps; run `# Suricata/Snort style triage:` then `jq -c 'select(.alert.severity<=2) | {ts:.timestamp, sig:.alert.signature, src:.src_ip, dst:.dest_ip}' /var/log/suricata/eve.json | tail -20`.
3. **Analyze.** Pull the kit URL from the email, fetch it in a sandbox, and extract the credential-post endpoint and any session-cookie exfiltration to scope which submissions completed. Then: For each submitter, check for concurrent sessions: revoke all refresh tokens and list OAuth app consents granted in the phish window.
4. **Contain and harden.** Move to phishing-resistant MFA (FIDO2/WebAuthn); TOTP and push MFA fall to AiTM relay. Asset layer: Sensors on SPAN/TAP at every trust boundary; signature sets auto-updated; TLS inspection feeding sensors. Environment layer: Standardized branch firewall policy deployed as code; no local admin exceptions.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Resetting the password without revoking sessions leaves the attacker logged in via stolen tokens.
- Blaming the clicker instead of fixing the control gap guarantees a repeat with a better lure.
