# Phishing Credential Harvest Defense for Message Queues in AWS Cloud (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Users are lured to lookalike login pages (often via adversary-in-the-middle kits that relay MFA) and submit credentials. The defender's job: find who clicked, who submitted, and whether sessions were hijacked even where MFA appeared to hold. Applies to Message Queues in AWS Cloud at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- Email gateway logs show a burst of messages with lookalike domains, newly registered domains, or QR-code lures pointing at a credential-harvest kit URL.
- Proxy/DNS logs show visits to the kit domain followed within minutes by logons from unusual IPs or impossible-travel pairs for the same user.
- AiTM kits leave telltales: logon session created without a matching MFA challenge event, or token replay from datacenter IP ranges.
- Lens: Best telemetry: queue depth/lag metrics + producer/consumer auth logs + dead-letter queues. Organization CloudTrail in all regions, GuardDuty, and VPC flow logs shipped to the security account.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to CloudWatch and workload logs centralized; S3 access logging on sensitive buckets.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Queue metrics: depth spikes, consumer lag, and poison-message dead-letter queues and Authentication logs for producers/consumers; new queue/topic creation events; run `rabbitmqctl list_queues name messages consumers 2>/dev/null | head -20` then `kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server <broker> --describe --all-groups 2>/dev/null | head -20`.
3. **Analyze.** Pull the kit URL from the email, fetch it in a sandbox, and extract the credential-post endpoint and any session-cookie exfiltration to scope which submissions completed. Then: For each submitter, check for concurrent sessions: revoke all refresh tokens and list OAuth app consents granted in the phish window.
4. **Contain and harden.** Move to phishing-resistant MFA (FIDO2/WebAuthn); TOTP and push MFA fall to AiTM relay. Asset layer: Authentication on all clients, TLS in transit, authorization per queue/topic, quotas on producers. Environment layer: SCPs as guardrails (deny leaving org, deny disabling logging, region restrictions).
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Resetting the password without revoking sessions leaves the attacker logged in via stolen tokens.
- Blaming the clicker instead of fixing the control gap guarantees a repeat with a better lure.
