# Scheduled Task Persistence Defense for Container Registries in Air-Gapped Networks (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Scheduled tasks are the most common Windows persistence: they survive reboots, run as SYSTEM, and hide among thousands of legitimate tasks. Hunt for tasks with odd actions, odd principals, or creation outside change windows. Applies to Container Registries in Air-Gapped Networks at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- 4698 (scheduled task created) with actions pointing at temp directories, encoded PowerShell, or LOLBins, especially running as SYSTEM.
- Tasks with misleading names mimicking legitimate ones (e.g., 'GoogleUpdateTaskMachineUA' in the wrong path), or tasks created outside maintenance windows.
- Task XML in C:\Windows\System32\Tasks with recent timestamps but no corresponding change record.
- Lens: Best telemetry: push/pull audit logs + image-scan results + signature verification logs. Local SIEM/log collector inside the enclave (no cloud shipping); removable-media transfer logs.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Strict allowlisting logs: every binary execution recorded, since the set is small and known.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Push/pull audit log (who pushed which tag/digest, who pulled it, from where) and Vulnerability scan results per image; signature (cosign/Notary) verification outcomes; run `reg audit log --since 7d --action push | head -30` then `reg scan results --image <image:tag> --severity high,critical`.
3. **Analyze.** Export the task XML and inspect actions, triggers, principals, and conditions — the full task definition is the evidence. Then: Determine creation vector: who/what created it (user, GPO, remote RPC) to find the still-active access path.
4. **Contain and harden.** Alert on 4698/4702 fleet-wide; restrict task creation rights and audit tasks running as SYSTEM quarterly. Asset layer: Image signing required, immutable tags for releases, vulnerability gates blocking critical CVEs. Environment layer: Data diodes or strictly controlled one-way transfers; media sanitization procedures for anything crossing.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Deleting the task but leaving the payload binary — many implants re-create their task on next execution.
- Trusting the task name; always inspect the action path and hash.
