# Group Policy Abuse Defense for Active Directory Domain Controllers in Hybrid Cloud (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Group Policy deploys to every machine in scope — including attacker-planted scheduled tasks, scripts, and software. A malicious GPO is a domain-wide persistence and execution platform; monitor GPO changes like code deployments. Applies to Active Directory Domain Controllers in Hybrid Cloud at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- 5136/5137 directory-service changes creating or modifying GPOs, especially new immediate scheduled tasks, startup scripts, or software installation policies.
- SYSVOL replication of unexpected scripts/executables, or GPO version number jumps without a change ticket.
- Mass host behavior change correlating with GP refresh cycles (new persistence appearing fleet-wide simultaneously).
- Lens: Best telemetry: forwarded Security logs (4768/4769/4771/4662/4720/4732/4724/5136) + AD replication monitoring. Unified SIEM ingesting both on-prem syslog and cloud audit trails with identity correlation across both.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Conditional-access and network logs covering the interconnect (ExpressRoute/Direct Connect/VPN).

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Security log Kerberos events (4768 TGT requests, 4769 service tickets, 4771 pre-auth failures) and Directory-service change events (5136/5137) and replication metadata (repadmin /showobjmeta); run `repadmin /showrepl | Select-String -Pattern 'error|fail' -Context 2` then `Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; Id=4769} -MaxEvents 200 | Group-Object {$_.Properties[0].Value} | Sort-Object Count -Descending | Select-Object -First 10 Name, Count`.
3. **Analyze.** Inspect the GPO's full settings and linked scripts; determine the deployment scope (which OUs) to size the affected fleet. Then: Check GPO backup/version history to find when the malicious change was introduced and by whom.
4. **Contain and harden.** Restrict GPO edit rights to a break-glass group, require change tickets, and alert on any GPO modification in real time. Asset layer: Tier-zero isolation: DCs on dedicated hosts, no browsing/email, admin access via PAW/jump host only. Environment layer: Consistent identity (single IdP) across on-prem and cloud; no parallel credential stores.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Deleting the malicious GPO without removing the persistence it already deployed to thousands of hosts.
- Missing GPO-based deployment because you hunted only local persistence mechanisms.
