# Drive-By Download Defense for Network Switches in Air-Gapped Networks (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Visiting a compromised or malicious page silently downloads malware via browser or plugin exploits. Patching and browser isolation remove the opportunity; proxy logs reveal the exposure. Applies to Network Switches in Air-Gapped Networks at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- Browser spawning unexpected child processes or writing executables to temp/downloads without user download action.
- Proxy logs showing visits to compromised sites followed by executable downloads, often via redirect chains.
- Exploit-kit patterns: rapid plugin version probing, obfuscated JavaScript, then payload fetch.
- Lens: Best telemetry: syslog (port up/down, STP changes, config changes) + SNMP/NetFlow + NAC logs. Local SIEM/log collector inside the enclave (no cloud shipping); removable-media transfer logs.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Strict allowlisting logs: every binary execution recorded, since the set is small and known.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Syslog: link-state changes, MAC flaps, STP topology changes, login attempts and MAC address tables and ARP tables for device-to-port mapping during incidents; run `show mac address-table | include <suspect-mac>` then `show logging | include %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP|%PORT_SECURITY`.
3. **Analyze.** Reconstruct the redirect chain from proxy logs to identify the compromised page or malvertising source. Then: Determine whether the payload executed: browser process tree and EDR execution events after the download timestamp.
4. **Contain and harden.** Automatic browser and OS patching; remove or sandbox legacy plugins (Java, Flash-era); consider browser isolation for high-risk users. Asset layer: Port security / 802.1X on access ports, BPDU guard, DHCP snooping + dynamic ARP inspection. Environment layer: Data diodes or strictly controlled one-way transfers; media sanitization procedures for anything crossing.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Assuming the user 'must have clicked something' — drive-bys need no click, so user interviews mislead.
- Cleaning the endpoint without blocking the compromised site that will re-infect the next visitor.
