# Cloud Console Takeover Defense for VMware ESXi Hosts in Remote Workforce (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Stolen cloud credentials used in the web console give attackers point-and-click infrastructure control. Console logons from unusual locations followed by IAM changes are the classic takeover sequence. Applies to VMware ESXi Hosts in Remote Workforce at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- CloudTrail/Entra sign-in logs showing console logons from new countries or anonymizing services for privileged users.
- IAM policy changes, new access keys, or new users created within minutes of the anomalous logon.
- Disabling of CloudTrail/logging or deletion of log data — the attacker covering tracks.
- Lens: Best telemetry: vCenter tasks/events + ESXi syslog + lockdown-mode audit. EDR on every endpoint as the primary sensor (no corporate network tap for remote hosts).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to VPN/ZTNA access logs and SaaS/IdP sign-in logs as the network-visibility substitute.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in vCenter tasks and events (VM power ops, snapshot create/delete, host profile changes) and ESXi hostd/vpxa logs and shell-access records; VM .vmx changes; run `esxcli system auditrecords local list | tail -20` then `vim-cmd vmsvc/getallvms 2>/dev/null | head -20`.
3. **Analyze.** Reconstruct the full API call sequence after takeover: what was created, modified, exfiltrated, or destroyed. Then: Check for persistence: new IAM users, roles with trust policies pointing outward, or modified instance user-data.
4. **Contain and harden.** Phishing-resistant MFA on all console users, especially root/ break-glass; SCPs preventing logging disablement. Asset layer: Lockdown mode on, isolated management network, unique per-host root passwords, MFA on vCenter. Environment layer: Zero-trust access: device compliance + MFA per application, not per network.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Rotating the compromised user's keys but missing the backdoor IAM role the attacker created.
- Trusting the account's own logs after the attacker had admin — verify against the immutable archive.
