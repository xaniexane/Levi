# MFA Fatigue Attack Defense for EDR Consoles in On-Premises Datacenter (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers with a stolen password spam push notifications until the victim approves one out of annoyance or confusion. The defense is push hygiene: number matching, context display, and rate limits on prompts. Applies to EDR Consoles in On-Premises Datacenter at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- Dozens of MFA push prompts to one user in minutes, especially at odd hours, followed by a single approval.
- An approval immediately followed by session activity from an unusual IP or device enrollment changes.
- Helpdesk reports of users 'getting lots of MFA prompts' in the days before the incident.
- Lens: Best telemetry: raw process/network telemetry + detection history + sensor health inventory. Full network tap/SPAN coverage at core and distribution layers feeding IDS and full-packet capture.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Centralized syslog from all infrastructure with NTP-synced timestamps for cross-device correlation.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Full process trees with command lines, hashes, and network connections for suspect hosts and Detection and response action history (isolations, kills, quarantines); run `# conceptually (EDR APIs differ):` then `edr-cli hunt process --hostname <host> --since 24h --tree`.
3. **Analyze.** Reconstruct the prompt storm: count, timing, and the approving event — then inventory the attacker's post-approval actions. Then: Check whether the attacker registered a new MFA method during the session (persistence via second factor).
4. **Contain and harden.** Number matching on all push MFA, show login context (app, location), and rate-limit prompts per user. Asset layer: Tamper protection locked with console-only disable, auto-isolation policies for high-severity detections. Environment layer: Physical access controls with badge logs correlatable to logical access during investigations.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Assuming an approved push means a legitimate user — approval is exactly what the attacker engineered.
- Not checking for newly registered MFA methods, which survive password resets.
