# Drive-By Download Defense for Microsoft Entra ID Tenants in Branch Offices (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Visiting a compromised or malicious page silently downloads malware via browser or plugin exploits. Patching and browser isolation remove the opportunity; proxy logs reveal the exposure. Applies to Microsoft Entra ID Tenants in Branch Offices at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- Browser spawning unexpected child processes or writing executables to temp/downloads without user download action.
- Proxy logs showing visits to compromised sites followed by executable downloads, often via redirect chains.
- Exploit-kit patterns: rapid plugin version probing, obfuscated JavaScript, then payload fetch.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Entra sign-in + audit logs streamed to Log Analytics/SIEM with 30+ day retention. SD-WAN/branch firewall logs forwarded centrally; local DHCP/DNS logs for device attribution.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NAC or port-level logs identifying which device was on which port during the incident.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Sign-in logs (interactive, non-interactive, service principal) with risk detections and MFA details and Audit logs: app registrations, consent grants, Conditional Access changes, role assignments; run `# Microsoft Graph (delegated admin): recent risky sign-ins` then `Get-MgAuditLogSignIn -Filter "riskState eq 'atRisk'" -Top 25 | Select-Object CreatedDateTime, UserPrincipalName, IpAddress, @{n='Risk';e={$_.RiskDetail}}`.
3. **Analyze.** Reconstruct the redirect chain from proxy logs to identify the compromised page or malvertising source. Then: Determine whether the payload executed: browser process tree and EDR execution events after the download timestamp.
4. **Contain and harden.** Automatic browser and OS patching; remove or sandbox legacy plugins (Java, Flash-era); consider browser isolation for high-risk users. Asset layer: Conditional Access: require phishing-resistant MFA, compliant devices, block legacy auth and risky sign-ins. Environment layer: Standardized branch firewall policy deployed as code; no local admin exceptions.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Assuming the user 'must have clicked something' — drive-bys need no click, so user interviews mislead.
- Cleaning the endpoint without blocking the compromised site that will re-infect the next visitor.
