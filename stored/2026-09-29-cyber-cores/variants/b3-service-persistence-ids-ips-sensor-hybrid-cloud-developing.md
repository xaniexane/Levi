# Malicious Service Persistence Defense for IDS/IPS Sensors in Hybrid Cloud (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers install or hijack Windows services for SYSTEM-level, reboot-surviving execution. Services are trusted by admins, so malicious ones hide with plausible names — verify the binary, not the display name. Applies to IDS/IPS Sensors in Hybrid Cloud at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- 7045 (service installed) with ImagePath in user-writable or temp directories, unsigned binaries, or names mimicking legit services.
- Existing service ImagePath changed (7045 with same name, new binary) or service binary replaced on disk.
- Services running as SYSTEM that were recently created and have no vendor documentation or change record.
- Lens: Best telemetry: alert logs with full packet captures for high-severity events + sensor health metrics. Unified SIEM ingesting both on-prem syslog and cloud audit trails with identity correlation across both.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Conditional-access and network logs covering the interconnect (ExpressRoute/Direct Connect/VPN).

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Signature alert logs with triggering packet payloads; anomaly-detection baselines and deviations and PCAP ring buffers for incident windows; sensor placement/coverage maps; run `# Suricata/Snort style triage:` then `jq -c 'select(.alert.severity<=2) | {ts:.timestamp, sig:.alert.signature, src:.src_ip, dst:.dest_ip}' /var/log/suricata/eve.json | tail -20`.
3. **Analyze.** Hash and detonate the service binary; check its signature status and first-seen date in threat intel. Then: Review the service account: LocalSystem services have maximum impact — scope accordingly.
4. **Contain and harden.** Alert on all 7045 events; require change tickets for new services and run services as least-privilege virtual accounts. Asset layer: Sensors on SPAN/TAP at every trust boundary; signature sets auto-updated; TLS inspection feeding sensors. Environment layer: Consistent identity (single IdP) across on-prem and cloud; no parallel credential stores.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Stopping the service without deleting it — it restarts on reboot.
- Missing service DLL hijacking (Services with ServiceDll in writable paths) while hunting only EXE-based services.
