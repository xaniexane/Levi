# Linux Privilege Escalation Defense for Message Queues in Branch Offices (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers turn a low-privilege Linux foothold into root via sudo misconfigurations, SUID binaries, kernel exploits, or writable service files. Harden the escalation paths and you contain most Linux intrusions at the beachhead. Applies to Message Queues in Branch Offices at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- Sudo invocations of unusual binaries, sudoers file reads by non-admins, or successful sudo from accounts that never used it before.
- Execution of known privesc enumeration scripts (LinPEAS-style), SUID binary abuse, or kernel exploit artifacts in logs.
- New entries in sudoers.d, unexpected SUID bits, or service files modified by non-root users.
- Lens: Best telemetry: queue depth/lag metrics + producer/consumer auth logs + dead-letter queues. SD-WAN/branch firewall logs forwarded centrally; local DHCP/DNS logs for device attribution.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NAC or port-level logs identifying which device was on which port during the incident.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Queue metrics: depth spikes, consumer lag, and poison-message dead-letter queues and Authentication logs for producers/consumers; new queue/topic creation events; run `rabbitmqctl list_queues name messages consumers 2>/dev/null | head -20` then `kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server <broker> --describe --all-groups 2>/dev/null | head -20`.
3. **Analyze.** Identify the exact escalation primitive: which misconfiguration or vulnerability was used, and whether it is systemic across the fleet or host-specific. Then: Check for persistence installed with the new privileges: new SSH keys in root's authorized_keys, cron jobs, or systemd units.
4. **Contain and harden.** Least-privilege sudoers (no NOPASSWD, no wildcards), remove SUID from unnecessary binaries, and keep kernels patched. Asset layer: Authentication on all clients, TLS in transit, authorization per queue/topic, quotas on producers. Environment layer: Standardized branch firewall policy deployed as code; no local admin exceptions.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Cleaning the host without fixing the fleet-wide sudoers misconfiguration that enabled it.
- Assuming container escape is out of scope — check whether the foothold was a container with host mounts.
