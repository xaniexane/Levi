# Credential Stuffing Defense for Container Registries in Azure Cloud (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers replay username/password pairs stolen from third-party breaches against your login endpoints, betting on password reuse. It shows up as high-volume failed logons from distributed IPs, occasionally followed by a small number of successful takeovers. Applies to Container Registries in Azure Cloud at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- Authentication logs show a spike in failed logons (often 100s per minute) from many source IPs against a single login endpoint, with a low success rate and common password patterns.
- Successful logons immediately followed by password or MFA changes, mailbox rule creation, or impossible-travel alerts for the same account within minutes.
- WAF/bot-management flags distributed requests with identical user-agent strings, headless-browser markers, or known credential-stuffing tool signatures.
- Lens: Best telemetry: push/pull audit logs + image-scan results + signature verification logs. Activity Log and Entra sign-in/audit logs streamed to Log Analytics/SIEM; Defender for Cloud alerts.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NSG flow logs and storage analytics for data-plane visibility.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Push/pull audit log (who pushed which tag/digest, who pulled it, from where) and Vulnerability scan results per image; signature (cosign/Notary) verification outcomes; run `reg audit log --since 7d --action push | head -30` then `reg scan results --image <image:tag> --severity high,critical`.
3. **Analyze.** Separate spray from stuffing: stuffing reuses many passwords per username from breach corpora; confirm by checking whether the attempted passwords appear in public breach datasets. Then: For each successful post-stuffing logon, inventory session actions: read mail rules, forwarding addresses, OAuth grants, and API keys created in the 24 hours after compromise.
4. **Contain and harden.** Enforce MFA everywhere and block legacy/basic authentication; stuffing dies against phishing-resistant MFA. Asset layer: Image signing required, immutable tags for releases, vulnerability gates blocking critical CVEs. Environment layer: Azure Policy deny-effects on risky configurations; PIM-gated subscription roles.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Blocking single IPs is whack-a-mole against botnets; block on behavior (velocity, fingerprint) rather than address.
- Forcing a fleet-wide password reset without confirming which accounts were actually taken over burns goodwill and teaches users to pick weaker passwords.
