# Process Injection Defense for Linux Servers in AWS Cloud (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Malware hides inside legitimate processes via injection (CreateRemoteThread, APC, process hollowing), blending with normal activity. Memory-focused detection — EDR telemetry and targeted memory analysis — is the answer; disk forensics alone misses it. Applies to Linux Servers in AWS Cloud at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- EDR alerts on cross-process memory writes (CreateRemoteThread, NtQueueApcThread) from unusual sources, or hollowed processes (image path mismatches the in-memory PE).
- Legitimate processes (explorer, svchost) making unexpected network connections or spawning children they never normally do.
- Sysmon event 8 (CreateRemoteThread) and event 10 (ProcessAccess) with suspicious granted-access masks.
- Lens: Best telemetry: auditd + centralized syslog/journald + osquery or an EDR agent. Organization CloudTrail in all regions, GuardDuty, and VPC flow logs shipped to the security account.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to CloudWatch and workload logs centralized; S3 access logging on sensitive buckets.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in auth.log/secure (SSH logons), auditd logs (execve, file writes), and cron tables (/etc/crontab, /etc/cron.d/*, user crontabs) and systemd unit files in /etc/systemd/system/ and SSH authorized_keys files for all users; run `sudo grep -E 'Failed|Accepted' /var/log/auth.log | tail -40` then `sudo ausearch -m EXECVE --start recent -i | grep -E 'curl|wget|bash|sh|python|perl' | tail -30`.
3. **Analyze.** Capture process memory before killing anything; extract the injected payload for family identification. Then: Trace the injector: which process performed the injection and how did IT get compromised (the delivery chain).
4. **Contain and harden.** EDR with behavioral blocking on injection primitives; application control to prevent the initial injector from running. Asset layer: Key-only SSH (no passwords), fail2ban or equivalent, unattended security updates enabled. Environment layer: SCPs as guardrails (deny leaving org, deny disabling logging, region restrictions).
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Killing the host process without capturing memory — the payload exists only in RAM and the evidence is gone.
- Whitelisting the injected process because its NAME is legitimate; verify the in-memory image, not the filename.
