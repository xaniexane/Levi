# Token Impersonation Defense for macOS Endpoints in On-Premises Datacenter (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers steal or duplicate Windows access tokens to act as another user — often SYSTEM — without knowing any password. EDR sees odd parent/child relationships and token-privilege enabling that legitimate software rarely performs. Applies to macOS Endpoints in On-Premises Datacenter at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- Processes enabling SeDebugPrivilege or SeImpersonatePrivilege outside of known admin tooling, or unexpected token duplication API sequences in EDR telemetry.
- A low-privilege process spawning children as SYSTEM or as another logged-on user without a legitimate service path.
- Named-pipe impersonation patterns (PrintSpooler-style) from non-printer processes.
- Lens: Best telemetry: unified log + EDR agent + Santa/Munki logs where deployed. Full network tap/SPAN coverage at core and distribution layers feeding IDS and full-packet capture.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Centralized syslog from all infrastructure with NTP-synced timestamps for cross-device correlation.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Unified log (log show) for process execution and auth events; login items and LaunchAgents/LaunchDaemons plists and Quarantine attributes (xattr com.apple.quarantine) on downloads; Gatekeeper assessment history; run `log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "sshd"' --last 2h | tail -20` then `ls -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ /Library/LaunchDaemons/ /Library/LaunchAgents/ 2>/dev/null`.
3. **Analyze.** Trace the token source: which process's token was stolen, and did that source process itself get compromised first? Then: Check what the impersonated context accessed — file, registry, and network actions taken as the victim identity.
4. **Contain and harden.** Remove SeImpersonatePrivilege from service accounts that do not need it; patch print-spooler-class vulnerabilities promptly. Asset layer: Gatekeeper + XProtect current, FileVault on, firewall on, and MDM-enforced configuration profiles. Environment layer: Physical access controls with badge logs correlatable to logical access during investigations.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Assuming token theft requires admin — some impersonation primitives work from lower privilege.
- Missing that a stolen token can be replayed on OTHER hosts via remote authentication.
