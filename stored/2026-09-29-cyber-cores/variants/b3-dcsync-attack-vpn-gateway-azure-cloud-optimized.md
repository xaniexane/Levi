# DCSync Attack Defense for VPN Gateways in Azure Cloud (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

With replication rights, an attacker impersonates a domain controller and pulls password hashes for ANY account — including krbtgt — via normal replication traffic. It looks like DC-to-DC chatter, which is why it evades naive monitoring. Applies to VPN Gateways in Azure Cloud at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- 4662 (directory object access) on the domain root or krbtgt account by a principal that is not a real domain controller.
- Replication traffic (DRS) originating from a non-DC host, or a DC requesting replication far outside the normal schedule.
- Newly granted DS-Replication-Get-Changes rights (especially Get-Changes-All) to users, groups, or computers.
- Lens: Best telemetry: authentication logs + session logs (user, IP, bytes, duration) + gateway patch state. Activity Log and Entra sign-in/audit logs streamed to Log Analytics/SIEM; Defender for Cloud alerts.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NSG flow logs and storage analytics for data-plane visibility.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in VPN auth logs (success/failure per user with source IPs), session tables with data volumes and Gateway admin audit log and firmware/patch version; client version inventory; run `# conceptually (vendor CLIs differ):` then `show vpn-sessiondb detail anyconnect | grep -E 'Username|Assigned IP|Login Time'`.
3. **Analyze.** Identify which account performed the sync and which hashes were pulled — a krbtgt pull means the entire domain's Kerberos trust must be reset (double krbtgt rotation). Then: Review how the attacker gained replication rights: compromised admin, delegated rights sprawl, or ACL abuse.
4. **Contain and harden.** Audit and strip replication rights to the minimum; alert on any grant of Get-Changes-All. Asset layer: MFA on every VPN profile, device posture checks before granting access, gateway firmware patched urgently. Environment layer: Azure Policy deny-effects on risky configurations; PIM-gated subscription roles.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Resetting user passwords but not the krbtgt — golden tickets forged from a stolen krbtgt survive password resets.
- Missing that DCSync needs only replication rights, not Domain Admin — delegated-rights sprawl is the usual enabler.
