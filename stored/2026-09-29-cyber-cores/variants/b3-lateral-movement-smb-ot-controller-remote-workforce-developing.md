# SMB Lateral Movement Defense for OT Controllers in Remote Workforce (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers move host-to-host over SMB using stolen credentials — PsExec-style service creation, admin shares, or WMI. In a flat network, one compromised workstation becomes the whole domain in hours. Applies to OT Controllers in Remote Workforce at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- SMB sessions from a workstation to many other hosts in a short window, especially to ADMIN$ or C$ shares the user never touches normally.
- Service creation events (7045) with service binaries in ADMIN$\system32, or 4624 type-3 logons with the same account across dozens of hosts.
- EDR process trees showing services.exe spawning cmd/powershell shortly after a remote SMB session.
- Lens: Best telemetry: passive OT network monitoring + engineering-workstation logs + change-management records. EDR on every endpoint as the primary sensor (no corporate network tap for remote hosts).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to VPN/ZTNA access logs and SaaS/IdP sign-in logs as the network-visibility substitute.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in OT protocol logs (Modbus/DNP3/OPC) from passive taps — never active-scan OT networks and Engineering workstation access and project-file change logs; run `# PASSIVE ONLY on OT networks — no active scanning:` then `tshark -r /captures/ot-span.pcap -Y 'modbus' -T fields -e frame.time -e modbus.func_code 2>/dev/null | head -20`.
3. **Analyze.** Map the movement graph: source host, credential used, target hosts, timestamps — this is the incident's skeleton. Then: Determine which credential enabled it (stolen hash, ticket, or plaintext) to know what must be rotated enterprise-wide.
4. **Contain and harden.** Segment the network (workstation-to-workstation SMB blocked), deploy LAPS for unique local admin passwords, and restrict lateral logon rights via tiered admin model. Asset layer: Air-gap or data-diode segmentation from IT, unidirectional gateways, strict change control on logic. Environment layer: Zero-trust access: device compliance + MFA per application, not per network.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Cleaning patient zero while the attacker's beachheads on hosts 3, 7, and 12 remain active.
- Rotating the compromised account's password but not the kerberos tickets/hashes already stolen from it.
