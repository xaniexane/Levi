# Secrets in Code Defense for AWS Accounts in On-Premises Datacenter (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

API keys, passwords, and tokens committed to repositories get scraped by attackers (and by every future repo reader). A committed secret is a compromised secret — rotate first, clean history second. Applies to AWS Accounts in On-Premises Datacenter at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- Secret-scanning alerts (push protection or historical scan) flagging keys, tokens, or private keys in commits.
- Anomalous API usage billed to a key that appears in a repository, or commits adding '.env' files.
- Public repository exposure: any secret ever pushed public is considered harvested.
- Lens: Best telemetry: CloudTrail (org trail, all regions) + GuardDuty + VPC flow logs + Config. Full network tap/SPAN coverage at core and distribution layers feeding IDS and full-packet capture.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Centralized syslog from all infrastructure with NTP-synced timestamps for cross-device correlation.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in CloudTrail event history (console logons, IAM changes, AssumeRole, security-group changes) and GuardDuty findings, IAM Access Analyzer results, and S3 server-access logs for data stores; run `aws cloudtrail lookup-events --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=EventName,AttributeValue=ConsoleLogin --max-items 20` then `aws iam generate-credential-report && aws iam get-credential-report --query Content --output text | base64 -d | head -5`.
3. **Analyze.** For each exposed secret: determine its privileges and check usage logs for unauthorized use since exposure. Then: Check git history depth: secrets in old commits are still exposed to anyone with repo access.
4. **Contain and harden.** Rotate the secret FIRST, then purge from history; enable push protection and pre-commit secret scanning. Asset layer: MFA on root + all IAM users, SCPs denying logging disablement and unapproved regions, no long-lived keys. Environment layer: Physical access controls with badge logs correlatable to logical access during investigations.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Deleting the commit without rotating — the secret is already copied.
- Scanning only main branch; secrets hide in feature branches, PRs, and forks.
