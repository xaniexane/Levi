# Log Tampering Defense for EDR Consoles in Branch Offices (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers clear or alter logs to blind defenders — event log clears, audit policy disabling, or timestomping. The tampering itself is evidence: treat cleared logs as confirmation of malicious activity, not as missing data. Applies to EDR Consoles in Branch Offices at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- Event 1102 (audit log cleared) or 104 (log cleared), audit policy changes disabling categories, or gaps in otherwise continuous log streams.
- Timestomped files (MFT timestamps inconsistent with sequence numbers) or syslog gaps from specific hosts.
- SIEM agent uninstalls or forwarding configuration changes.
- Lens: Best telemetry: raw process/network telemetry + detection history + sensor health inventory. SD-WAN/branch firewall logs forwarded centrally; local DHCP/DNS logs for device attribution.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NAC or port-level logs identifying which device was on which port during the incident.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Full process trees with command lines, hashes, and network connections for suspect hosts and Detection and response action history (isolations, kills, quarantines); run `# conceptually (EDR APIs differ):` then `edr-cli hunt process --hostname <host> --since 24h --tree`.
3. **Analyze.** The clear event's timestamp bounds the attacker's active window — focus forensic effort just before it. Then: Recover from redundant sources: EDR cloud telemetry, network logs, and central syslog often survive local clears.
4. **Contain and harden.** Forward logs off-host in real time to tamper-evident central storage; alert on 1102/104 immediately. Asset layer: Tamper protection locked with console-only disable, auto-isolation policies for high-severity detections. Environment layer: Standardized branch firewall policy deployed as code; no local admin exceptions.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Treating 'no logs' as 'no evidence of compromise' — absence after tampering IS the evidence.
- Relying solely on host logs; always have an independent telemetry path (network, EDR cloud).
