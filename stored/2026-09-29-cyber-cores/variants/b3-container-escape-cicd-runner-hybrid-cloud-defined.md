# Container Escape Defense for CI/CD Runners in Hybrid Cloud (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

A compromised container breaks out to the host via privileged mode, hostPath mounts, or kernel exploits — turning one application breach into full node control. Harden the container boundary and monitor for escape primitives. Applies to CI/CD Runners in Hybrid Cloud at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- Containers running privileged or with hostPath mounts to sensitive host paths, especially created outside normal deployments.
- Host-level processes spawned by container runtimes, or unexpected writes to host paths from container contexts.
- Kernel exploit artifacts or abuse of host namespaces (nsenter-style) inside container workloads.
- Lens: Best telemetry: job execution logs + runner registration events + secret-access audit. Unified SIEM ingesting both on-prem syslog and cloud audit trails with identity correlation across both.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Conditional-access and network logs covering the interconnect (ExpressRoute/Direct Connect/VPN).

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Job logs with executed commands and exit codes for suspect runs and Runner registration/deregistration events and runner version inventory; run `runner-cli jobs list --status failed --last 7d | head -20` then `runner-cli runners list --format table`.
3. **Analyze.** Determine the escape primitive: misconfiguration (privileged, hostPath, hostPID) versus kernel CVE — the fix differs. Then: Assess node compromise: if escaped, the node is hostile — cordon, drain, and rebuild it; do not trust in-place cleaning.
4. **Contain and harden.** Never run privileged containers; drop capabilities, use read-only root filesystems, and enforce via admission controllers (OPA/Kyverno). Asset layer: Ephemeral isolated runners, OIDC short-lived credentials, no persistent secrets on runners. Environment layer: Consistent identity (single IdP) across on-prem and cloud; no parallel credential stores.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Rebuilding the container while the compromised node keeps serving the attacker's workloads.
- Assuming non-privileged means safe — hostPath mounts and capabilities can be equally fatal.
