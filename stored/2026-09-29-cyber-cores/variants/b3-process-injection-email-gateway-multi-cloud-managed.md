# Process Injection Defense for Email Gateways in Multi-Cloud (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Malware hides inside legitimate processes via injection (CreateRemoteThread, APC, process hollowing), blending with normal activity. Memory-focused detection — EDR telemetry and targeted memory analysis — is the answer; disk forensics alone misses it. Applies to Email Gateways in Multi-Cloud at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- EDR alerts on cross-process memory writes (CreateRemoteThread, NtQueueApcThread) from unusual sources, or hollowed processes (image path mismatches the in-memory PE).
- Legitimate processes (explorer, svchost) making unexpected network connections or spawning children they never normally do.
- Sysmon event 8 (CreateRemoteThread) and event 10 (ProcessAccess) with suspicious granted-access masks.
- Lens: Best telemetry: message-tracking logs + sandbox verdicts + URL-rewrite click logs. Cloud-agnostic SIEM normalizing AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Log, and GCP Audit Logs into one schema.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to CSPM coverage across all clouds with consistent misconfiguration alerting.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Message tracking (sender, recipients, subject hash, attachments, verdicts) for the campaign window and Sandbox detonation reports for attachments/URLs; quarantined message copies; run `# conceptually (gateway CLIs differ):` then `message-tracking --sender <suspect-domain> --last 7d`.
3. **Analyze.** Capture process memory before killing anything; extract the injected payload for family identification. Then: Trace the injector: which process performed the injection and how did IT get compromised (the delivery chain).
4. **Contain and harden.** EDR with behavioral blocking on injection primitives; application control to prevent the initial injector from running. Asset layer: Sandbox detonation for all attachments/links, DMARC p=reject on owned domains, banner external mail. Environment layer: Federated identity across clouds from one IdP; consistent tagging and logging standards per cloud.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Killing the host process without capturing memory — the payload exists only in RAM and the evidence is gone.
- Whitelisting the injected process because its NAME is legitimate; verify the in-memory image, not the filename.
