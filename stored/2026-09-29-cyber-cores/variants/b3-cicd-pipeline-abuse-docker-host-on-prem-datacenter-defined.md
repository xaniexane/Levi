# CI/CD Pipeline Abuse Defense for Docker Hosts in On-Premises Datacenter (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Compromised build pipelines inject malicious code into artifacts or exfiltrate secrets from build environments. Pipelines hold production credentials AND ship code — treat them as tier-zero assets. Applies to Docker Hosts in On-Premises Datacenter at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- Pipeline runs triggered outside normal commits, modified build scripts, or runners executing unexpected network calls.
- Secrets accessed by pipeline jobs that never needed them, or new pipeline variables containing exfil endpoints.
- Artifacts whose hashes differ from reproducible-build expectations.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Docker daemon logs + host auditd + container stdout/stderr shipped centrally. Full network tap/SPAN coverage at core and distribution layers feeding IDS and full-packet capture.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Centralized syslog from all infrastructure with NTP-synced timestamps for cross-device correlation.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Docker daemon log (container create/start with full flags), docker events history and Container image digests and layer histories (docker history) versus expected digests; run `docker ps --format '{{.Names}} {{.Image}}' ; echo ---; docker events --since 24h --until 0s 2>/dev/null | tail -20` then `docker inspect $(docker ps -q) --format '{{.Name}} privileged={{.HostConfig.Privileged}} mounts={{.Mounts}}' 2>/dev/null`.
3. **Analyze.** Diff the pipeline definition against the last known-good version; identify exactly which jobs were tampered with. Then: Determine which secrets the compromised jobs could read and rotate all of them — assume exposure.
4. **Contain and harden.** Pipeline definitions in version control with required reviews; ephemeral, isolated runners; OIDC-based short-lived credentials instead of stored secrets. Asset layer: No --privileged, no host socket mounts except for explicit agents, user namespaces enabled, read-only root filesystems. Environment layer: Physical access controls with badge logs correlatable to logical access during investigations.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Cleaning the pipeline but shipping artifacts it already poisoned — quarantine recent builds.
- Long-lived cloud credentials stored as pipeline secrets; rotate and replace with OIDC federation.
