# Process Injection Defense for Load Balancers in On-Premises Datacenter (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Malware hides inside legitimate processes via injection (CreateRemoteThread, APC, process hollowing), blending with normal activity. Memory-focused detection — EDR telemetry and targeted memory analysis — is the answer; disk forensics alone misses it. Applies to Load Balancers in On-Premises Datacenter at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- EDR alerts on cross-process memory writes (CreateRemoteThread, NtQueueApcThread) from unusual sources, or hollowed processes (image path mismatches the in-memory PE).
- Legitimate processes (explorer, svchost) making unexpected network connections or spawning children they never normally do.
- Sysmon event 8 (CreateRemoteThread) and event 10 (ProcessAccess) with suspicious granted-access masks.
- Lens: Best telemetry: access logs with X-Forwarded-For + backend health flaps + config-change audit. Full network tap/SPAN coverage at core and distribution layers feeding IDS and full-packet capture.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Centralized syslog from all infrastructure with NTP-synced timestamps for cross-device correlation.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Access logs (client IP, Host header, URI, status, bytes) — the edge view of web attacks and Backend pool changes and health-check failure histories; run `grep -E ' 4[0-9]{2} ' /var/log/haproxy.log | awk '{print $6}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -15` then `echo 'show stat' | socat unix-connect:/var/run/haproxy.sock stdio 2>/dev/null | cut -d, -f1,2,18 | head -20`.
3. **Analyze.** Capture process memory before killing anything; extract the injected payload for family identification. Then: Trace the injector: which process performed the injection and how did IT get compromised (the delivery chain).
4. **Contain and harden.** EDR with behavioral blocking on injection primitives; application control to prevent the initial injector from running. Asset layer: TLS 1.2+ with strong ciphers, HSTS, WAF integration at the edge, config changes via version control. Environment layer: Physical access controls with badge logs correlatable to logical access during investigations.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Killing the host process without capturing memory — the payload exists only in RAM and the evidence is gone.
- Whitelisting the injected process because its NAME is legitimate; verify the in-memory image, not the filename.
