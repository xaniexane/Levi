# Secrets in Code Defense for OT Controllers in Remote Workforce (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

API keys, passwords, and tokens committed to repositories get scraped by attackers (and by every future repo reader). A committed secret is a compromised secret — rotate first, clean history second. Applies to OT Controllers in Remote Workforce at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- Secret-scanning alerts (push protection or historical scan) flagging keys, tokens, or private keys in commits.
- Anomalous API usage billed to a key that appears in a repository, or commits adding '.env' files.
- Public repository exposure: any secret ever pushed public is considered harvested.
- Lens: Best telemetry: passive OT network monitoring + engineering-workstation logs + change-management records. EDR on every endpoint as the primary sensor (no corporate network tap for remote hosts).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to VPN/ZTNA access logs and SaaS/IdP sign-in logs as the network-visibility substitute.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in OT protocol logs (Modbus/DNP3/OPC) from passive taps — never active-scan OT networks and Engineering workstation access and project-file change logs; run `# PASSIVE ONLY on OT networks — no active scanning:` then `tshark -r /captures/ot-span.pcap -Y 'modbus' -T fields -e frame.time -e modbus.func_code 2>/dev/null | head -20`.
3. **Analyze.** For each exposed secret: determine its privileges and check usage logs for unauthorized use since exposure. Then: Check git history depth: secrets in old commits are still exposed to anyone with repo access.
4. **Contain and harden.** Rotate the secret FIRST, then purge from history; enable push protection and pre-commit secret scanning. Asset layer: Air-gap or data-diode segmentation from IT, unidirectional gateways, strict change control on logic. Environment layer: Zero-trust access: device compliance + MFA per application, not per network.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Deleting the commit without rotating — the secret is already copied.
- Scanning only main branch; secrets hide in feature branches, PRs, and forks.
