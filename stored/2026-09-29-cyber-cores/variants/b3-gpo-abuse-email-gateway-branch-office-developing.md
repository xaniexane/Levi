# Group Policy Abuse Defense for Email Gateways in Branch Offices (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Group Policy deploys to every machine in scope — including attacker-planted scheduled tasks, scripts, and software. A malicious GPO is a domain-wide persistence and execution platform; monitor GPO changes like code deployments. Applies to Email Gateways in Branch Offices at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- 5136/5137 directory-service changes creating or modifying GPOs, especially new immediate scheduled tasks, startup scripts, or software installation policies.
- SYSVOL replication of unexpected scripts/executables, or GPO version number jumps without a change ticket.
- Mass host behavior change correlating with GP refresh cycles (new persistence appearing fleet-wide simultaneously).
- Lens: Best telemetry: message-tracking logs + sandbox verdicts + URL-rewrite click logs. SD-WAN/branch firewall logs forwarded centrally; local DHCP/DNS logs for device attribution.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NAC or port-level logs identifying which device was on which port during the incident.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Message tracking (sender, recipients, subject hash, attachments, verdicts) for the campaign window and Sandbox detonation reports for attachments/URLs; quarantined message copies; run `# conceptually (gateway CLIs differ):` then `message-tracking --sender <suspect-domain> --last 7d`.
3. **Analyze.** Inspect the GPO's full settings and linked scripts; determine the deployment scope (which OUs) to size the affected fleet. Then: Check GPO backup/version history to find when the malicious change was introduced and by whom.
4. **Contain and harden.** Restrict GPO edit rights to a break-glass group, require change tickets, and alert on any GPO modification in real time. Asset layer: Sandbox detonation for all attachments/links, DMARC p=reject on owned domains, banner external mail. Environment layer: Standardized branch firewall policy deployed as code; no local admin exceptions.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Deleting the malicious GPO without removing the persistence it already deployed to thousands of hosts.
- Missing GPO-based deployment because you hunted only local persistence mechanisms.
