# Linux Privilege Escalation Defense for Code Repositories in On-Premises Datacenter (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers turn a low-privilege Linux foothold into root via sudo misconfigurations, SUID binaries, kernel exploits, or writable service files. Harden the escalation paths and you contain most Linux intrusions at the beachhead. Applies to Code Repositories in On-Premises Datacenter at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- Sudo invocations of unusual binaries, sudoers file reads by non-admins, or successful sudo from accounts that never used it before.
- Execution of known privesc enumeration scripts (LinPEAS-style), SUID binary abuse, or kernel exploit artifacts in logs.
- New entries in sudoers.d, unexpected SUID bits, or service files modified by non-root users.
- Lens: Best telemetry: push/audit logs + secret-scanning alerts + branch-protection change history. Full network tap/SPAN coverage at core and distribution layers feeding IDS and full-packet capture.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Centralized syslog from all infrastructure with NTP-synced timestamps for cross-device correlation.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Push logs (who pushed what to which branch), force-push and history-rewrite records and Secret-scanning and code-scanning alerts with their resolution state; run `git log --since='7 days ago' --format='%h %an %ad %s' --date=short | head -30` then `git log --all --diff-filter=A -- '*secret*' '*credential*' '*key*' --format='%h %an %s' | head -20`.
3. **Analyze.** Identify the exact escalation primitive: which misconfiguration or vulnerability was used, and whether it is systemic across the fleet or host-specific. Then: Check for persistence installed with the new privileges: new SSH keys in root's authorized_keys, cron jobs, or systemd units.
4. **Contain and harden.** Least-privilege sudoers (no NOPASSWD, no wildcards), remove SUID from unnecessary binaries, and keep kernels patched. Asset layer: Branch protection with required reviews, signed commits, push protection for secrets. Environment layer: Physical access controls with badge logs correlatable to logical access during investigations.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Cleaning the host without fixing the fleet-wide sudoers misconfiguration that enabled it.
- Assuming container escape is out of scope — check whether the foothold was a container with host mounts.
