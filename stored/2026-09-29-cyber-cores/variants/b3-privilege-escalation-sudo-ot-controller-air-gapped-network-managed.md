# Linux Privilege Escalation Defense for OT Controllers in Air-Gapped Networks (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers turn a low-privilege Linux foothold into root via sudo misconfigurations, SUID binaries, kernel exploits, or writable service files. Harden the escalation paths and you contain most Linux intrusions at the beachhead. Applies to OT Controllers in Air-Gapped Networks at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- Sudo invocations of unusual binaries, sudoers file reads by non-admins, or successful sudo from accounts that never used it before.
- Execution of known privesc enumeration scripts (LinPEAS-style), SUID binary abuse, or kernel exploit artifacts in logs.
- New entries in sudoers.d, unexpected SUID bits, or service files modified by non-root users.
- Lens: Best telemetry: passive OT network monitoring + engineering-workstation logs + change-management records. Local SIEM/log collector inside the enclave (no cloud shipping); removable-media transfer logs.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Strict allowlisting logs: every binary execution recorded, since the set is small and known.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in OT protocol logs (Modbus/DNP3/OPC) from passive taps — never active-scan OT networks and Engineering workstation access and project-file change logs; run `# PASSIVE ONLY on OT networks — no active scanning:` then `tshark -r /captures/ot-span.pcap -Y 'modbus' -T fields -e frame.time -e modbus.func_code 2>/dev/null | head -20`.
3. **Analyze.** Identify the exact escalation primitive: which misconfiguration or vulnerability was used, and whether it is systemic across the fleet or host-specific. Then: Check for persistence installed with the new privileges: new SSH keys in root's authorized_keys, cron jobs, or systemd units.
4. **Contain and harden.** Least-privilege sudoers (no NOPASSWD, no wildcards), remove SUID from unnecessary binaries, and keep kernels patched. Asset layer: Air-gap or data-diode segmentation from IT, unidirectional gateways, strict change control on logic. Environment layer: Data diodes or strictly controlled one-way transfers; media sanitization procedures for anything crossing.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Cleaning the host without fixing the fleet-wide sudoers misconfiguration that enabled it.
- Assuming container escape is out of scope — check whether the foothold was a container with host mounts.
