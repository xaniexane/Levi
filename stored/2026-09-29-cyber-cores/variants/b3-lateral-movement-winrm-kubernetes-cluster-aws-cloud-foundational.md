# WinRM Lateral Movement Defense for Kubernetes Clusters in AWS Cloud (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

Windows Remote Management gives attackers remote PowerShell on any host where WinRM is enabled — quieter than PsExec, built into the OS, and often left on by default in enterprises. Applies to Kubernetes Clusters in AWS Cloud at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- WinRM operational log (Microsoft-Windows-WinRM/Operational) showing connections from non-admin workstations, or wsmprovhost spawning powershell with encoded commands.
- Event 4624 type-3 logons to the WinRM port (5985/5986) from hosts outside the management subnet.
- PowerShell remoting sessions (event 400/800) executing reconnaissance or credential-access commands.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Kubernetes audit logs + container runtime logs + admission-controller denials. Organization CloudTrail in all regions, GuardDuty, and VPC flow logs shipped to the security account.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to CloudWatch and workload logs centralized; S3 access logging on sensitive buckets.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in API-server audit log (who created pods/bindings/secrets, from where) and Kubelet/container runtime logs and image pull histories per node; run `kubectl audit2rbac --filename=audit.log 2>/dev/null | head; kubectl get clusterrolebindings -o wide | head -20` then `kubectl get pods -A -o json | python3 -c "import json,sys; [print(p['metadata']['namespace'], p['metadata']['name'], p['spec'].get('hostNetwork'), p['spec'].get('hostPID')) for p in json.load(sys.stdin)['items']]" | head -30`.
3. **Analyze.** Extract the remote commands from PowerShell operational logs (4104) on the target to see exactly what the attacker ran. Then: Inventory which hosts have WinRM enabled and reachable — the attack surface is every one of them.
4. **Contain and harden.** Restrict WinRM to management hosts via host firewall and GPO; disable where not needed. Asset layer: Least-privilege RBAC, Pod Security Standards enforced, no privileged pods, image signing/verification. Environment layer: SCPs as guardrails (deny leaving org, deny disabling logging, region restrictions).
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Forgetting WinRM over HTTPS (5986) when firewalling only 5985.
- PowerShell logging gaps: without module/script-block logging, remote commands are invisible — enable both.
