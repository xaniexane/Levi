# Data Exfiltration Defense for Load Balancers in AWS Cloud (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

Sensitive data leaving the network — the moment an intrusion becomes a breach. Quantifying WHAT left is more important than blocking the channel after the fact; notification obligations depend on the data, not the technique. Applies to Load Balancers in AWS Cloud at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- Egress spikes: large uploads to external hosts, cloud storage, or paste sites from servers that normally receive more than they send.
- Staging activity: large archives (zip/7z/rar) created in temp directories, database dumps, or mailbox exports shortly before the transfer.
- DLP alerts on regulated data patterns (SSN, card numbers, PHI formats) in outbound traffic, or DNS/ICMP exfil at low volume.
- Lens: Best telemetry: access logs with X-Forwarded-For + backend health flaps + config-change audit. Organization CloudTrail in all regions, GuardDuty, and VPC flow logs shipped to the security account.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to CloudWatch and workload logs centralized; S3 access logging on sensitive buckets.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Access logs (client IP, Host header, URI, status, bytes) — the edge view of web attacks and Backend pool changes and health-check failure histories; run `grep -E ' 4[0-9]{2} ' /var/log/haproxy.log | awk '{print $6}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -15` then `echo 'show stat' | socat unix-connect:/var/run/haproxy.sock stdio 2>/dev/null | cut -d, -f1,2,18 | head -20`.
3. **Analyze.** Reconstruct the exfil set: source paths, file types, record counts, and data classification — involve legal early for notification scoping. Then: Preserve full packet/proxy logs of the transfer; they prove what left and are evidence for regulators and law enforcement.
4. **Contain and harden.** DLP policies with blocking on bulk sensitive-data egress, plus alerting on archive creation and database dump commands. Asset layer: TLS 1.2+ with strong ciphers, HSTS, WAF integration at the edge, config changes via version control. Environment layer: SCPs as guardrails (deny leaving org, deny disabling logging, region restrictions).
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Stopping the transfer but never determining what was in it — you cannot scope a breach on 'we blocked something'.
- Forgetting cloud audit logs: exfil via sanctioned SaaS (personal Drive, Dropbox) bypasses network DLP.
