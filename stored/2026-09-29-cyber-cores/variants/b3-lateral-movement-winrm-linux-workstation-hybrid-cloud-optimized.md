# WinRM Lateral Movement Defense for Linux Workstations in Hybrid Cloud (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Windows Remote Management gives attackers remote PowerShell on any host where WinRM is enabled — quieter than PsExec, built into the OS, and often left on by default in enterprises. Applies to Linux Workstations in Hybrid Cloud at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- WinRM operational log (Microsoft-Windows-WinRM/Operational) showing connections from non-admin workstations, or wsmprovhost spawning powershell with encoded commands.
- Event 4624 type-3 logons to the WinRM port (5985/5986) from hosts outside the management subnet.
- PowerShell remoting sessions (event 400/800) executing reconnaissance or credential-access commands.
- Lens: Best telemetry: auditd user-session logging + EDR agent + desktop shell histories (with user notice). Unified SIEM ingesting both on-prem syslog and cloud audit trails with identity correlation across both.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Conditional-access and network logs covering the interconnect (ExpressRoute/Direct Connect/VPN).

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in User shell histories (~/.bash_history), desktop autostart entries (~/.config/autostart/) and auditd execve logs and USB device logs; browser profiles for web-vector cases; run `ls -la ~/.config/autostart/ 2>/dev/null; grep -r 'Exec=' ~/.config/autostart/ 2>/dev/null` then `sudo ausearch --start recent -m EXECVE -i | tail -30`.
3. **Analyze.** Extract the remote commands from PowerShell operational logs (4104) on the target to see exactly what the attacker ran. Then: Inventory which hosts have WinRM enabled and reachable — the attack surface is every one of them.
4. **Contain and harden.** Restrict WinRM to management hosts via host firewall and GPO; disable where not needed. Asset layer: Standard user accounts for daily work, full-disk encryption, and screen-lock enforcement. Environment layer: Consistent identity (single IdP) across on-prem and cloud; no parallel credential stores.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Forgetting WinRM over HTTPS (5986) when firewalling only 5985.
- PowerShell logging gaps: without module/script-block logging, remote commands are invisible — enable both.
