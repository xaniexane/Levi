# Drive-By Download Defense for Container Registries in Colocation Facilities (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Visiting a compromised or malicious page silently downloads malware via browser or plugin exploits. Patching and browser isolation remove the opportunity; proxy logs reveal the exposure. Applies to Container Registries in Colocation Facilities at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- Browser spawning unexpected child processes or writing executables to temp/downloads without user download action.
- Proxy logs showing visits to compromised sites followed by executable downloads, often via redirect chains.
- Exploit-kit patterns: rapid plugin version probing, obfuscated JavaScript, then payload fetch.
- Lens: Best telemetry: push/pull audit logs + image-scan results + signature verification logs. Customer-owned network taps and logging (the colo provider's logs are out of scope — verify contractually).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Badge/physical access logs from the facility correlated with remote-hand ticket times.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Push/pull audit log (who pushed which tag/digest, who pulled it, from where) and Vulnerability scan results per image; signature (cosign/Notary) verification outcomes; run `reg audit log --since 7d --action push | head -30` then `reg scan results --image <image:tag> --severity high,critical`.
3. **Analyze.** Reconstruct the redirect chain from proxy logs to identify the compromised page or malvertising source. Then: Determine whether the payload executed: browser process tree and EDR execution events after the download timestamp.
4. **Contain and harden.** Automatic browser and OS patching; remove or sandbox legacy plugins (Java, Flash-era); consider browser isolation for high-risk users. Asset layer: Image signing required, immutable tags for releases, vulnerability gates blocking critical CVEs. Environment layer: Locked cabinets, private cages, and escort policies for remote hands.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Assuming the user 'must have clicked something' — drive-bys need no click, so user interviews mislead.
- Cleaning the endpoint without blocking the compromised site that will re-infect the next visitor.
