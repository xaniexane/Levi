# Watering Hole Attack Defense for CI/CD Runners in Hybrid Cloud (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers compromise websites your targets frequent, turning trusted browsing into infection. Detection is epidemiological: multiple infections sharing one browsing history overlap. Applies to CI/CD Runners in Hybrid Cloud at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- Several hosts infected with the same payload whose proxy histories share a common site visited shortly before each infection.
- A trusted industry/partner site serving malicious scripts or redirects (verified via sandbox fetch).
- Infections clustered by department or role matching the compromised site's audience.
- Lens: Best telemetry: job execution logs + runner registration events + secret-access audit. Unified SIEM ingesting both on-prem syslog and cloud audit trails with identity correlation across both.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Conditional-access and network logs covering the interconnect (ExpressRoute/Direct Connect/VPN).

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Job logs with executed commands and exit codes for suspect runs and Runner registration/deregistration events and runner version inventory; run `runner-cli jobs list --status failed --last 7d | head -20` then `runner-cli runners list --format table`.
3. **Analyze.** Confirm the watering hole by fetching the suspect site in a sandbox and capturing the injected code. Then: Enumerate all visitors to the site in the compromise window — the exposed population, not just the infected.
4. **Contain and harden.** Notify the site owner; block the malicious URLs/paths (not necessarily the whole domain) at the proxy. Asset layer: Ephemeral isolated runners, OIDC short-lived credentials, no persistent secrets on runners. Environment layer: Consistent identity (single IdP) across on-prem and cloud; no parallel credential stores.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Treating each infection as independent and missing the common source — always compare browsing histories across cases.
- Blocking the entire legitimate domain permanently instead of the injected path, breaking business access.
