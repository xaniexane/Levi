# Business Email Compromise Defense for Web Applications in Colocation Facilities (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers operate inside a compromised mailbox (or a lookalike domain) to redirect payments, harvest invoices, or pivot to executives. Dwell time is often weeks; the fraud, not the malware, is the payload. Applies to Web Applications in Colocation Facilities at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- Mailbox audit logs show inbox rules created to move or delete messages containing 'invoice', 'payment', 'wire', or executive names — the classic BEC rule footprint.
- Outbound messages to finance vendors from a slightly altered domain, or a legitimate mailbox suddenly sending payment-change requests with urgent tone.
- Logons to the mailbox from foreign IPs or anonymizing VPNs followed by long read-only sessions (the attacker learning the payment workflow before striking).
- Lens: Best telemetry: app audit logs (with authenticated identity) + WAF logs + structured access logs. Customer-owned network taps and logging (the colo provider's logs are out of scope — verify contractually).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Badge/physical access logs from the facility correlated with remote-hand ticket times.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Application audit log: who did what to which object, with session IDs and source IPs and WAF block logs and anomaly scores; web-server access/error logs around the incident; run `grep -E ' 4[0-9]{2} | 5[0-9]{2} ' /var/log/nginx/access.log | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -15` then `journalctl -u myapp --since '2 hours ago' | grep -iE 'error|unauthor|exception' | tail -30`.
3. **Analyze.** Export all inbox/transport rules for the affected mailbox and diff against a known-good baseline; BEC rules often hide with names like ';' or whitespace. Then: Trace every payment instruction the mailbox sent in the dwell window: which were acted on, which bank details changed, and whether funds are recallable.
4. **Contain and harden.** Require out-of-band (voice/video) verification for any payment detail change, no exceptions, and alert on new inbox rules fleet-wide. Asset layer: Authorization checks on every object reference, output encoding, parameterized queries, secure session handling. Environment layer: Locked cabinets, private cages, and escort policies for remote hands.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Focusing only on the compromised mailbox while the attacker already harvested the vendor's thread and will re-target from another account.
- Treating a lookalike-domain BEC as an IT problem alone — finance process change is the actual fix.
