# Insider Data Theft Defense for SSO Identity Providers in Air-Gapped Networks (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

A trusted user steals data — often before resignation. Unlike external attacks there is no malware to find; detection relies on behavioral baselines: access volume, off-hours activity, and personal-storage uploads. Handle with HR and legal from the start. Applies to SSO Identity Providers in Air-Gapped Networks at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- A user accessing far more files or records than their role baseline, especially in the 30 days before resignation or termination.
- Bulk downloads to USB, personal cloud uploads, or emailing attachments to personal addresses from a corporate account.
- Off-hours access to repositories the user never touched before, or permission changes granting themselves broader access.
- Lens: Best telemetry: authentication logs with MFA detail + app-assignment changes + federation trust changes. Local SIEM/log collector inside the enclave (no cloud shipping); removable-media transfer logs.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Strict allowlisting logs: every binary execution recorded, since the set is small and known.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Authentication logs per application (success/failure, MFA method, device, location) and Application assignment and provisioning logs; new SSO integrations; run `# conceptually (IdP APIs differ):` then `idp-cli logs auth --user <upn> --last 7d --format table | head -25`.
3. **Analyze.** Build a 90-day access timeline for the user: volume, data sensitivity, destination (USB serial, cloud account, personal email) — coordinate collection with HR/legal to stay compliant. Then: Determine business justification for each anomaly with the user's manager before concluding malice; over-collection without cause creates liability.
4. **Contain and harden.** UEBA baselines with alerting on pre-resignation access spikes; disable USB mass storage or enforce encryption + logging. Asset layer: Phishing-resistant MFA default, sign-on policies per app risk, session lifetime limits. Environment layer: Data diodes or strictly controlled one-way transfers; media sanitization procedures for anything crossing.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Investigating without HR/legal involvement — privacy and employment law exposure is real.
- Confronting the user before evidence is preserved; they will delete local copies first.
