# ASREPRoasting Defense for EDR Consoles in Hybrid Cloud (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Accounts with Kerberos pre-authentication disabled can have their AS-REP responses requested by anyone and cracked offline — no authentication needed at all. One misconfigured user account is enough. Applies to EDR Consoles in Hybrid Cloud at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- 4768 (TGT request) events where pre-authentication was not used, from external or unexpected hosts, for accounts flagged DONT_REQ_PREAUTH.
- Enumeration of such accounts (LDAP queries for userAccountControl flags) preceding the roast requests.
- Later logons with the cracked credentials from attacker hosts.
- Lens: Best telemetry: raw process/network telemetry + detection history + sensor health inventory. Unified SIEM ingesting both on-prem syslog and cloud audit trails with identity correlation across both.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Conditional-access and network logs covering the interconnect (ExpressRoute/Direct Connect/VPN).

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Full process trees with command lines, hashes, and network connections for suspect hosts and Detection and response action history (isolations, kills, quarantines); run `# conceptually (EDR APIs differ):` then `edr-cli hunt process --hostname <host> --since 24h --tree`.
3. **Analyze.** Enumerate all accounts with pre-auth disabled (the full roast-able population) — the fix is one checkbox per account, so find them all. Then: Check whether any of those accounts are privileged or service accounts; prioritize accordingly.
4. **Contain and harden.** Enable Kerberos pre-authentication on every account; audit for the flag regularly — it gets re-disabled by legacy app troubleshooting. Asset layer: Tamper protection locked with console-only disable, auto-isolation policies for high-severity detections. Environment layer: Consistent identity (single IdP) across on-prem and cloud; no parallel credential stores.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Fixing the roasted account but not scanning for the other 40 accounts with the same misconfiguration.
- Assuming pre-auth-disabled accounts are always legacy — verify before re-enabling to avoid breaking production auth.
