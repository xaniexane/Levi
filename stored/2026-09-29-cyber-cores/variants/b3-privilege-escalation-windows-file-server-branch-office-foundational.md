# Windows Privilege Escalation Defense for File Servers in Branch Offices (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

From standard user to SYSTEM/Administrator via unquoted service paths, writable service binaries, AlwaysInstallElevated, token manipulation, or kernel exploits. Windows privesc is usually a misconfiguration the attacker read, not a zero-day they brought. Applies to File Servers in Branch Offices at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- Service creation or modification events (7045/4697) pointing at user-writable paths, or processes spawning as SYSTEM from unexpected parents.
- Registry writes to AlwaysInstallElevated keys, accessibility binary replacement (sethc/utilman), or token duplication API patterns in EDR telemetry.
- Enumeration tooling: whoami /priv, accesschk, or PowerShell privesc scripts running before the escalation.
- Lens: Best telemetry: object-access auditing (who opened/modified what) + share-permission reviews. SD-WAN/branch firewall logs forwarded centrally; local DHCP/DNS logs for device attribution.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NAC or port-level logs identifying which device was on which port during the incident.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in File-access audit events (4663/4656 on Windows; auditd on Linux) for sensitive shares and Share and NTFS/ACL permission exports; recent permission-change events; run `Get-SmbShare | Select-Object Name, Path, Description; echo ---; Get-SmbShareAccess -Name <share>` then `Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; Id=4663} -MaxEvents 100 | Group-Object {$_.Properties[1].Value} | Sort-Object Count -Descending | Select-Object -First 10 Name, Count`.
3. **Analyze.** Pin down the primitive: unquoted path, weak service ACL, scheduled task with stored creds, or kernel CVE — then check how many fleet hosts share it. Then: Review what the elevated access touched: SAM/LSASS access after escalation means credential theft followed.
4. **Contain and harden.** Fix service ACLs and paths fleet-wide, disable AlwaysInstallElevated, and enforce signed-driver and LSA protection policies. Asset layer: Access-based enumeration, least-privilege share/NTFS rights, no Everyone:Full Control anywhere. Environment layer: Standardized branch firewall policy deployed as code; no local admin exceptions.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Reimaging one host while the GPO-deployed misconfiguration recreates the hole on every rebuild.
- Missing that the attacker already dumped credentials post-escalation — scope the follow-on theft, not just the privesc.
