# Ransomware Encryption Defense for Linux Workstations in Multi-Cloud (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

Ransomware encrypts files and demands payment, usually after days of dwell time spent disabling recovery. Speed of isolation decides whether you lose one host or the fleet. Never pay without a deliberate, documented decision process. Applies to Linux Workstations in Multi-Cloud at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- EDR fires on mass file rename/extension changes, vssadmin delete shadows, bcdedit recovery disabling, or known ransomware process names within seconds of each other.
- Ransom notes (README, DECRYPT files) appearing in multiple directories, wallpaper changes, or a sudden burst of encrypted file extensions across shares.
- Precursor activity in the prior 72 hours: disabled EDR tamper protection, cleared event logs, or backup job failures and backup-server logons from unusual accounts.
- Lens: Best telemetry: auditd user-session logging + EDR agent + desktop shell histories (with user notice). Cloud-agnostic SIEM normalizing AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Log, and GCP Audit Logs into one schema.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to CSPM coverage across all clouds with consistent misconfiguration alerting.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in User shell histories (~/.bash_history), desktop autostart entries (~/.config/autostart/) and auditd execve logs and USB device logs; browser profiles for web-vector cases; run `ls -la ~/.config/autostart/ 2>/dev/null; grep -r 'Exec=' ~/.config/autostart/ 2>/dev/null` then `sudo ausearch --start recent -m EXECVE -i | tail -30`.
3. **Analyze.** Identify the variant from the note text, extension, and ransom portal; check public decryptor availability before any recovery decision — some variants have free decryptors. Then: Reconstruct the entry vector (phishing, exposed RDP/VPN, software vulnerability) and the dwell timeline: first access, privilege escalation, backup targeting, detonation.
4. **Contain and harden.** Immutable, offline-tested backups with alerting on backup tampering; network segmentation so one host cannot reach all shares. Asset layer: Standard user accounts for daily work, full-disk encryption, and screen-lock enforcement. Environment layer: Federated identity across clouds from one IdP; consistent tagging and logging standards per cloud.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Rebuilding from backups that the attacker already found and poisoned — verify backup integrity and isolation first.
- Paying the ransom without confirming the decryptor works and without legal/regulatory review of sanctions exposure.
