# Malicious PowerShell Abuse Defense for File Servers in Azure Cloud (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

PowerShell is the attacker's Swiss-army knife: encoded commands, in-memory execution, credential theft, lateral movement. Deep script-block and module logging turns it from a blind spot into one of your richest telemetry sources. Applies to File Servers in Azure Cloud at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- Event 4104 (script block logging) with encoded commands (-enc/-e), Invoke-Mimikatz/Invoke-Shellcode patterns, or obfuscation (heavy string concatenation, char codes).
- PowerShell spawned by Office, browsers, or WMI with hidden window styles, or AMSI bypass patterns in the script text.
- Module logging showing credential-access or AD-enumeration cmdlets from non-admin workstations.
- Lens: Best telemetry: object-access auditing (who opened/modified what) + share-permission reviews. Activity Log and Entra sign-in/audit logs streamed to Log Analytics/SIEM; Defender for Cloud alerts.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NSG flow logs and storage analytics for data-plane visibility.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in File-access audit events (4663/4656 on Windows; auditd on Linux) for sensitive shares and Share and NTFS/ACL permission exports; recent permission-change events; run `Get-SmbShare | Select-Object Name, Path, Description; echo ---; Get-SmbShareAccess -Name <share>` then `Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; Id=4663} -MaxEvents 100 | Group-Object {$_.Properties[1].Value} | Sort-Object Count -Descending | Select-Object -First 10 Name, Count`.
3. **Analyze.** Decode every obfuscated layer — the final script reveals the true objective (many 'downloaders' are actually ransomware staging). Then: Correlate the PowerShell session with its parent to find the delivery vector (macro, scheduled task, remote session).
4. **Contain and harden.** Enable script-block logging, module logging, and transcription fleet-wide; forward to the SIEM with alerting. Asset layer: Access-based enumeration, least-privilege share/NTFS rights, no Everyone:Full Control anywhere. Environment layer: Azure Policy deny-effects on risky configurations; PIM-gated subscription roles.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Logging PowerShell without a SIEM pipeline to analyze it — 4104 events are high-volume and useless unsearched.
- Assuming -noprofile -w hidden is always malicious; admins use it too — baseline first.
