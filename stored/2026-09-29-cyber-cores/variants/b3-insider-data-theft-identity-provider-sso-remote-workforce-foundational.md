# Insider Data Theft Defense for SSO Identity Providers in Remote Workforce (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

A trusted user steals data — often before resignation. Unlike external attacks there is no malware to find; detection relies on behavioral baselines: access volume, off-hours activity, and personal-storage uploads. Handle with HR and legal from the start. Applies to SSO Identity Providers in Remote Workforce at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- A user accessing far more files or records than their role baseline, especially in the 30 days before resignation or termination.
- Bulk downloads to USB, personal cloud uploads, or emailing attachments to personal addresses from a corporate account.
- Off-hours access to repositories the user never touched before, or permission changes granting themselves broader access.
- Lens: Best telemetry: authentication logs with MFA detail + app-assignment changes + federation trust changes. EDR on every endpoint as the primary sensor (no corporate network tap for remote hosts).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to VPN/ZTNA access logs and SaaS/IdP sign-in logs as the network-visibility substitute.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Authentication logs per application (success/failure, MFA method, device, location) and Application assignment and provisioning logs; new SSO integrations; run `# conceptually (IdP APIs differ):` then `idp-cli logs auth --user <upn> --last 7d --format table | head -25`.
3. **Analyze.** Build a 90-day access timeline for the user: volume, data sensitivity, destination (USB serial, cloud account, personal email) — coordinate collection with HR/legal to stay compliant. Then: Determine business justification for each anomaly with the user's manager before concluding malice; over-collection without cause creates liability.
4. **Contain and harden.** UEBA baselines with alerting on pre-resignation access spikes; disable USB mass storage or enforce encryption + logging. Asset layer: Phishing-resistant MFA default, sign-on policies per app risk, session lifetime limits. Environment layer: Zero-trust access: device compliance + MFA per application, not per network.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Investigating without HR/legal involvement — privacy and employment law exposure is real.
- Confronting the user before evidence is preserved; they will delete local copies first.
