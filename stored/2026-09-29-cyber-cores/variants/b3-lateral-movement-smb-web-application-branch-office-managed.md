# SMB Lateral Movement Defense for Web Applications in Branch Offices (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers move host-to-host over SMB using stolen credentials — PsExec-style service creation, admin shares, or WMI. In a flat network, one compromised workstation becomes the whole domain in hours. Applies to Web Applications in Branch Offices at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- SMB sessions from a workstation to many other hosts in a short window, especially to ADMIN$ or C$ shares the user never touches normally.
- Service creation events (7045) with service binaries in ADMIN$\system32, or 4624 type-3 logons with the same account across dozens of hosts.
- EDR process trees showing services.exe spawning cmd/powershell shortly after a remote SMB session.
- Lens: Best telemetry: app audit logs (with authenticated identity) + WAF logs + structured access logs. SD-WAN/branch firewall logs forwarded centrally; local DHCP/DNS logs for device attribution.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NAC or port-level logs identifying which device was on which port during the incident.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Application audit log: who did what to which object, with session IDs and source IPs and WAF block logs and anomaly scores; web-server access/error logs around the incident; run `grep -E ' 4[0-9]{2} | 5[0-9]{2} ' /var/log/nginx/access.log | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -15` then `journalctl -u myapp --since '2 hours ago' | grep -iE 'error|unauthor|exception' | tail -30`.
3. **Analyze.** Map the movement graph: source host, credential used, target hosts, timestamps — this is the incident's skeleton. Then: Determine which credential enabled it (stolen hash, ticket, or plaintext) to know what must be rotated enterprise-wide.
4. **Contain and harden.** Segment the network (workstation-to-workstation SMB blocked), deploy LAPS for unique local admin passwords, and restrict lateral logon rights via tiered admin model. Asset layer: Authorization checks on every object reference, output encoding, parameterized queries, secure session handling. Environment layer: Standardized branch firewall policy deployed as code; no local admin exceptions.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Cleaning patient zero while the attacker's beachheads on hosts 3, 7, and 12 remain active.
- Rotating the compromised account's password but not the kerberos tickets/hashes already stolen from it.
