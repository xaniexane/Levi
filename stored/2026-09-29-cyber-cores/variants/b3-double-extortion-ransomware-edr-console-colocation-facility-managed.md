# Double-Extortion Ransomware Defense for EDR Consoles in Colocation Facilities (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Data is exfiltrated BEFORE encryption, so the attacker can leak it even if you restore from backups. The investigation must answer what was stolen, not just what was encrypted — breach notification clocks start on exfiltration. Applies to EDR Consoles in Colocation Facilities at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- Large outbound transfers (tens of GB) to cloud storage, file shares, or anonymized endpoints in the days before encryption, often via rclone, MEGAsync, or custom tooling.
- Staging directories with archived/renamed sensitive data (databases, file shares zipped) and data-leak-site monitoring hits for your organization name.
- The ransom note references specific stolen files or threatens publication with a countdown timer.
- Lens: Best telemetry: raw process/network telemetry + detection history + sensor health inventory. Customer-owned network taps and logging (the colo provider's logs are out of scope — verify contractually).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Badge/physical access logs from the facility correlated with remote-hand ticket times.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Full process trees with command lines, hashes, and network connections for suspect hosts and Detection and response action history (isolations, kills, quarantines); run `# conceptually (EDR APIs differ):` then `edr-cli hunt process --hostname <host> --since 24h --tree`.
3. **Analyze.** Quantify the exfil: source directories, file types, record counts, and whether regulated data (PII, PHI, card data) was included — this drives notification obligations. Then: Preserve exfiltration logs (proxy, firewall, DLP, cloud audit) as evidence; they are also the proof of what did and did not leave.
4. **Contain and harden.** DLP egress policies on sensitive data stores plus alerting on bulk archive creation and large outbound transfers. Asset layer: Tamper protection locked with console-only disable, auto-isolation policies for high-severity detections. Environment layer: Locked cabinets, private cages, and escort policies for remote hands.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Declaring victory after restoring from backup while stolen data sits on a leak site — the extortion continues.
- Starting the notification clock at encryption time instead of at first confirmed exfiltration.
