# WinRM Lateral Movement Defense for Proxy Servers in GCP Cloud (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Windows Remote Management gives attackers remote PowerShell on any host where WinRM is enabled — quieter than PsExec, built into the OS, and often left on by default in enterprises. Applies to Proxy Servers in GCP Cloud at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- WinRM operational log (Microsoft-Windows-WinRM/Operational) showing connections from non-admin workstations, or wsmprovhost spawning powershell with encoded commands.
- Event 4624 type-3 logons to the WinRM port (5985/5986) from hosts outside the management subnet.
- PowerShell remoting sessions (event 400/800) executing reconnaissance or credential-access commands.
- Lens: Best telemetry: full URL logs with user identity + TLS SNI logs + block/allow verdicts. Cloud Audit Logs (admin + data access) exported to a locked-down logging project.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Security Command Center findings and VPC flow logs centralized.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Access logs (user, URL, category, verdict, bytes) for the incident window and Blocked-request logs showing attempted C2/malware/phishing destinations; run `grep <username> /var/log/squid/access.log | awk '{print $7}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20` then `grep -E 'TCP_DENIED|BLOCK' /var/log/squid/access.log | tail -30`.
3. **Analyze.** Extract the remote commands from PowerShell operational logs (4104) on the target to see exactly what the attacker ran. Then: Inventory which hosts have WinRM enabled and reachable — the attack surface is every one of them.
4. **Contain and harden.** Restrict WinRM to management hosts via host firewall and GPO; disable where not needed. Asset layer: Authenticated proxying (no anonymous egress), category blocking, TLS inspection where policy allows. Environment layer: Organization policies constraining public exposure, API enablement, and service-account key creation.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Forgetting WinRM over HTTPS (5986) when firewalling only 5985.
- PowerShell logging gaps: without module/script-block logging, remote commands are invisible — enable both.
