# Phishing Credential Harvest Defense for Web Applications in Branch Offices (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

Users are lured to lookalike login pages (often via adversary-in-the-middle kits that relay MFA) and submit credentials. The defender's job: find who clicked, who submitted, and whether sessions were hijacked even where MFA appeared to hold. Applies to Web Applications in Branch Offices at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- Email gateway logs show a burst of messages with lookalike domains, newly registered domains, or QR-code lures pointing at a credential-harvest kit URL.
- Proxy/DNS logs show visits to the kit domain followed within minutes by logons from unusual IPs or impossible-travel pairs for the same user.
- AiTM kits leave telltales: logon session created without a matching MFA challenge event, or token replay from datacenter IP ranges.
- Lens: Best telemetry: app audit logs (with authenticated identity) + WAF logs + structured access logs. SD-WAN/branch firewall logs forwarded centrally; local DHCP/DNS logs for device attribution.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NAC or port-level logs identifying which device was on which port during the incident.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Application audit log: who did what to which object, with session IDs and source IPs and WAF block logs and anomaly scores; web-server access/error logs around the incident; run `grep -E ' 4[0-9]{2} | 5[0-9]{2} ' /var/log/nginx/access.log | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -15` then `journalctl -u myapp --since '2 hours ago' | grep -iE 'error|unauthor|exception' | tail -30`.
3. **Analyze.** Pull the kit URL from the email, fetch it in a sandbox, and extract the credential-post endpoint and any session-cookie exfiltration to scope which submissions completed. Then: For each submitter, check for concurrent sessions: revoke all refresh tokens and list OAuth app consents granted in the phish window.
4. **Contain and harden.** Move to phishing-resistant MFA (FIDO2/WebAuthn); TOTP and push MFA fall to AiTM relay. Asset layer: Authorization checks on every object reference, output encoding, parameterized queries, secure session handling. Environment layer: Standardized branch firewall policy deployed as code; no local admin exceptions.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Resetting the password without revoking sessions leaves the attacker logged in via stolen tokens.
- Blaming the clicker instead of fixing the control gap guarantees a repeat with a better lure.
