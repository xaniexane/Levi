# Active Directory ACL Abuse Defense for Active Directory Domain Controllers in Air-Gapped Networks (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers abuse delegated Active Directory permissions — WriteDacl, GenericAll, ForceChangePassword — to escalate without exploits. These are legitimate rights granted too broadly, so detection means auditing WHO can do WHAT, continuously. Applies to Active Directory Domain Controllers in Air-Gapped Networks at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- 4662 events showing writes to security descriptors (WriteDacl / WriteOwner) on privileged groups, OUs, or the AdminSDHolder container.
- Password resets (4724) performed by non-helpdesk accounts, or new ACEs granting GenericAll over high-value targets.
- BloodHound-style LDAP enumeration (large object reads) preceding the ACL change — the attacker mapping attack paths.
- Lens: Best telemetry: forwarded Security logs (4768/4769/4771/4662/4720/4732/4724/5136) + AD replication monitoring. Local SIEM/log collector inside the enclave (no cloud shipping); removable-media transfer logs.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Strict allowlisting logs: every binary execution recorded, since the set is small and known.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Security log Kerberos events (4768 TGT requests, 4769 service tickets, 4771 pre-auth failures) and Directory-service change events (5136/5137) and replication metadata (repadmin /showobjmeta); run `repadmin /showrepl | Select-String -Pattern 'error|fail' -Context 2` then `Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; Id=4769} -MaxEvents 200 | Group-Object {$_.Properties[0].Value} | Sort-Object Count -Descending | Select-Object -First 10 Name, Count`.
3. **Analyze.** Diff the object's ACL before and after: which principal gained which right, and was it granted through nested group membership? Then: Map the attack path the new right enables (e.g., GenericAll on a group -> add self -> Domain Admin) to scope the blast radius.
4. **Contain and harden.** Least-privilege delegation: no GenericAll/WriteDacl outside Domain Admins; regular ACL audits with alerting on changes to protected objects. Asset layer: Tier-zero isolation: DCs on dedicated hosts, no browsing/email, admin access via PAW/jump host only. Environment layer: Data diodes or strictly controlled one-way transfers; media sanitization procedures for anything crossing.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- One-time ACL cleanup without continuous monitoring — delegation sprawl regrows within months.
- Forgetting nested groups: the dangerous ACE is often three group-nestings away from the attacker.
