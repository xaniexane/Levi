# Watering Hole Attack Defense for Load Balancers in Colocation Facilities (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers compromise websites your targets frequent, turning trusted browsing into infection. Detection is epidemiological: multiple infections sharing one browsing history overlap. Applies to Load Balancers in Colocation Facilities at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- Several hosts infected with the same payload whose proxy histories share a common site visited shortly before each infection.
- A trusted industry/partner site serving malicious scripts or redirects (verified via sandbox fetch).
- Infections clustered by department or role matching the compromised site's audience.
- Lens: Best telemetry: access logs with X-Forwarded-For + backend health flaps + config-change audit. Customer-owned network taps and logging (the colo provider's logs are out of scope — verify contractually).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Badge/physical access logs from the facility correlated with remote-hand ticket times.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Access logs (client IP, Host header, URI, status, bytes) — the edge view of web attacks and Backend pool changes and health-check failure histories; run `grep -E ' 4[0-9]{2} ' /var/log/haproxy.log | awk '{print $6}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -15` then `echo 'show stat' | socat unix-connect:/var/run/haproxy.sock stdio 2>/dev/null | cut -d, -f1,2,18 | head -20`.
3. **Analyze.** Confirm the watering hole by fetching the suspect site in a sandbox and capturing the injected code. Then: Enumerate all visitors to the site in the compromise window — the exposed population, not just the infected.
4. **Contain and harden.** Notify the site owner; block the malicious URLs/paths (not necessarily the whole domain) at the proxy. Asset layer: TLS 1.2+ with strong ciphers, HSTS, WAF integration at the edge, config changes via version control. Environment layer: Locked cabinets, private cages, and escort policies for remote hands.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Treating each infection as independent and missing the common source — always compare browsing histories across cases.
- Blocking the entire legitimate domain permanently instead of the injected path, breaking business access.
