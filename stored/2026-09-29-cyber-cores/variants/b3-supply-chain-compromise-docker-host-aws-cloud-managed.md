# Supply Chain Compromise Defense for Docker Hosts in AWS Cloud (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Trusted software updates or vendor components carry the attacker's payload — the hardest vector to prevent, because the malware arrives signed and expected. Defense shifts to verification, segmentation, and vendor scrutiny. Applies to Docker Hosts in AWS Cloud at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- A signed, trusted application suddenly exhibiting C2 communication or spawning unexpected children after an update.
- Threat intel or vendor advisory naming a specific product version as compromised.
- Anomalous behavior correlated tightly with a software update timestamp across many hosts.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Docker daemon logs + host auditd + container stdout/stderr shipped centrally. Organization CloudTrail in all regions, GuardDuty, and VPC flow logs shipped to the security account.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to CloudWatch and workload logs centralized; S3 access logging on sensitive buckets.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Docker daemon log (container create/start with full flags), docker events history and Container image digests and layer histories (docker history) versus expected digests; run `docker ps --format '{{.Names}} {{.Image}}' ; echo ---; docker events --since 24h --until 0s 2>/dev/null | tail -20` then `docker inspect $(docker ps -q) --format '{{.Name}} privileged={{.HostConfig.Privileged}} mounts={{.Mounts}}' 2>/dev/null`.
3. **Analyze.** Identify the trojanized version and enumerate every host that installed it — the exposure list defines the response scope. Then: Determine what the implanted component could access (its privilege level and data reach) to bound the impact.
4. **Contain and harden.** Software allowlisting with version pinning; staged update rollouts with behavioral monitoring before fleet-wide deploy. Asset layer: No --privileged, no host socket mounts except for explicit agents, user namespaces enabled, read-only root filesystems. Environment layer: SCPs as guardrails (deny leaving org, deny disabling logging, region restrictions).
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Assuming signed = safe; supply-chain malware is signed by definition.
- Delaying response waiting for the vendor's statement while the implant remains active.
