# Backup Tampering Defense for Web Applications in Colocation Facilities (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers delete, encrypt, or corrupt backups before the main attack so recovery is impossible. Backup systems are targeted FIRST in modern ransomware — monitor them as the crown jewels they are. Applies to Web Applications in Colocation Facilities at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- Backup job deletions, retention policy changes, or repository credential changes outside change windows.
- Backup admin console logons from unusual accounts or hosts, or mass snapshot deletions in cloud backup vaults.
- Backup integrity check failures or sudden drops in restorable recovery points.
- Lens: Best telemetry: app audit logs (with authenticated identity) + WAF logs + structured access logs. Customer-owned network taps and logging (the colo provider's logs are out of scope — verify contractually).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Badge/physical access logs from the facility correlated with remote-hand ticket times.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Application audit log: who did what to which object, with session IDs and source IPs and WAF block logs and anomaly scores; web-server access/error logs around the incident; run `grep -E ' 4[0-9]{2} | 5[0-9]{2} ' /var/log/nginx/access.log | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -15` then `journalctl -u myapp --since '2 hours ago' | grep -iE 'error|unauthor|exception' | tail -30`.
3. **Analyze.** Determine which recovery points were destroyed versus merely marked deleted — cloud soft-delete and immutable vaults may still hold copies. Then: Identify how the attacker reached the backup system: shared credentials, unpatched console, or compromised admin.
4. **Contain and harden.** Immutable backup storage (object lock / immutable vaults) with separate credentials and MFA on the backup console. Asset layer: Authorization checks on every object reference, output encoding, parameterized queries, secure session handling. Environment layer: Locked cabinets, private cages, and escort policies for remote hands.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Backups on the same domain credentials as production — the attacker uses the same keys on both.
- Monitoring backup job success but never testing an actual restore.
