# Container Escape Defense for Web Applications in Branch Offices (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

A compromised container breaks out to the host via privileged mode, hostPath mounts, or kernel exploits — turning one application breach into full node control. Harden the container boundary and monitor for escape primitives. Applies to Web Applications in Branch Offices at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- Containers running privileged or with hostPath mounts to sensitive host paths, especially created outside normal deployments.
- Host-level processes spawned by container runtimes, or unexpected writes to host paths from container contexts.
- Kernel exploit artifacts or abuse of host namespaces (nsenter-style) inside container workloads.
- Lens: Best telemetry: app audit logs (with authenticated identity) + WAF logs + structured access logs. SD-WAN/branch firewall logs forwarded centrally; local DHCP/DNS logs for device attribution.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NAC or port-level logs identifying which device was on which port during the incident.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Application audit log: who did what to which object, with session IDs and source IPs and WAF block logs and anomaly scores; web-server access/error logs around the incident; run `grep -E ' 4[0-9]{2} | 5[0-9]{2} ' /var/log/nginx/access.log | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -15` then `journalctl -u myapp --since '2 hours ago' | grep -iE 'error|unauthor|exception' | tail -30`.
3. **Analyze.** Determine the escape primitive: misconfiguration (privileged, hostPath, hostPID) versus kernel CVE — the fix differs. Then: Assess node compromise: if escaped, the node is hostile — cordon, drain, and rebuild it; do not trust in-place cleaning.
4. **Contain and harden.** Never run privileged containers; drop capabilities, use read-only root filesystems, and enforce via admission controllers (OPA/Kyverno). Asset layer: Authorization checks on every object reference, output encoding, parameterized queries, secure session handling. Environment layer: Standardized branch firewall policy deployed as code; no local admin exceptions.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Rebuilding the container while the compromised node keeps serving the attacker's workloads.
- Assuming non-privileged means safe — hostPath mounts and capabilities can be equally fatal.
