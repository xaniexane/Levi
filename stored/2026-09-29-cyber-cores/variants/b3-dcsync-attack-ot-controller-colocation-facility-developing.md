# DCSync Attack Defense for OT Controllers in Colocation Facilities (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

With replication rights, an attacker impersonates a domain controller and pulls password hashes for ANY account — including krbtgt — via normal replication traffic. It looks like DC-to-DC chatter, which is why it evades naive monitoring. Applies to OT Controllers in Colocation Facilities at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- 4662 (directory object access) on the domain root or krbtgt account by a principal that is not a real domain controller.
- Replication traffic (DRS) originating from a non-DC host, or a DC requesting replication far outside the normal schedule.
- Newly granted DS-Replication-Get-Changes rights (especially Get-Changes-All) to users, groups, or computers.
- Lens: Best telemetry: passive OT network monitoring + engineering-workstation logs + change-management records. Customer-owned network taps and logging (the colo provider's logs are out of scope — verify contractually).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Badge/physical access logs from the facility correlated with remote-hand ticket times.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in OT protocol logs (Modbus/DNP3/OPC) from passive taps — never active-scan OT networks and Engineering workstation access and project-file change logs; run `# PASSIVE ONLY on OT networks — no active scanning:` then `tshark -r /captures/ot-span.pcap -Y 'modbus' -T fields -e frame.time -e modbus.func_code 2>/dev/null | head -20`.
3. **Analyze.** Identify which account performed the sync and which hashes were pulled — a krbtgt pull means the entire domain's Kerberos trust must be reset (double krbtgt rotation). Then: Review how the attacker gained replication rights: compromised admin, delegated rights sprawl, or ACL abuse.
4. **Contain and harden.** Audit and strip replication rights to the minimum; alert on any grant of Get-Changes-All. Asset layer: Air-gap or data-diode segmentation from IT, unidirectional gateways, strict change control on logic. Environment layer: Locked cabinets, private cages, and escort policies for remote hands.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Resetting user passwords but not the krbtgt — golden tickets forged from a stolen krbtgt survive password resets.
- Missing that DCSync needs only replication rights, not Domain Admin — delegated-rights sprawl is the usual enabler.
