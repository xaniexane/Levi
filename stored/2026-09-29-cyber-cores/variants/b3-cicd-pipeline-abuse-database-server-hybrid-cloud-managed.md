# CI/CD Pipeline Abuse Defense for Database Servers in Hybrid Cloud (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Compromised build pipelines inject malicious code into artifacts or exfiltrate secrets from build environments. Pipelines hold production credentials AND ship code — treat them as tier-zero assets. Applies to Database Servers in Hybrid Cloud at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- Pipeline runs triggered outside normal commits, modified build scripts, or runners executing unexpected network calls.
- Secrets accessed by pipeline jobs that never needed them, or new pipeline variables containing exfil endpoints.
- Artifacts whose hashes differ from reproducible-build expectations.
- Lens: Best telemetry: query audit logs (who ran what) + auth logs + backup/restore history. Unified SIEM ingesting both on-prem syslog and cloud audit trails with identity correlation across both.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Conditional-access and network logs covering the interconnect (ExpressRoute/Direct Connect/VPN).

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Database audit log: logons, privileged statements (DCL/DDL), and bulk-export queries and Slow/general query logs around the incident window; new users, roles, or linked servers; run `-- PostgreSQL style:` then `SELECT usename, query, query_start FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state='active' ORDER BY query_start;`.
3. **Analyze.** Diff the pipeline definition against the last known-good version; identify exactly which jobs were tampered with. Then: Determine which secrets the compromised jobs could read and rotate all of them — assume exposure.
4. **Contain and harden.** Pipeline definitions in version control with required reviews; ephemeral, isolated runners; OIDC-based short-lived credentials instead of stored secrets. Asset layer: Least-privilege DB roles, no app superusers, encrypted connections, auditing on privileged actions. Environment layer: Consistent identity (single IdP) across on-prem and cloud; no parallel credential stores.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Cleaning the pipeline but shipping artifacts it already poisoned — quarantine recent builds.
- Long-lived cloud credentials stored as pipeline secrets; rotate and replace with OIDC federation.
