# Insider Data Theft Defense for Docker Hosts in Azure Cloud (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

A trusted user steals data — often before resignation. Unlike external attacks there is no malware to find; detection relies on behavioral baselines: access volume, off-hours activity, and personal-storage uploads. Handle with HR and legal from the start. Applies to Docker Hosts in Azure Cloud at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- A user accessing far more files or records than their role baseline, especially in the 30 days before resignation or termination.
- Bulk downloads to USB, personal cloud uploads, or emailing attachments to personal addresses from a corporate account.
- Off-hours access to repositories the user never touched before, or permission changes granting themselves broader access.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Docker daemon logs + host auditd + container stdout/stderr shipped centrally. Activity Log and Entra sign-in/audit logs streamed to Log Analytics/SIEM; Defender for Cloud alerts.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NSG flow logs and storage analytics for data-plane visibility.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Docker daemon log (container create/start with full flags), docker events history and Container image digests and layer histories (docker history) versus expected digests; run `docker ps --format '{{.Names}} {{.Image}}' ; echo ---; docker events --since 24h --until 0s 2>/dev/null | tail -20` then `docker inspect $(docker ps -q) --format '{{.Name}} privileged={{.HostConfig.Privileged}} mounts={{.Mounts}}' 2>/dev/null`.
3. **Analyze.** Build a 90-day access timeline for the user: volume, data sensitivity, destination (USB serial, cloud account, personal email) — coordinate collection with HR/legal to stay compliant. Then: Determine business justification for each anomaly with the user's manager before concluding malice; over-collection without cause creates liability.
4. **Contain and harden.** UEBA baselines with alerting on pre-resignation access spikes; disable USB mass storage or enforce encryption + logging. Asset layer: No --privileged, no host socket mounts except for explicit agents, user namespaces enabled, read-only root filesystems. Environment layer: Azure Policy deny-effects on risky configurations; PIM-gated subscription roles.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Investigating without HR/legal involvement — privacy and employment law exposure is real.
- Confronting the user before evidence is preserved; they will delete local copies first.
