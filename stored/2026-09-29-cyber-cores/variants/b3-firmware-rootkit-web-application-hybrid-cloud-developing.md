# Firmware Rootkit Defense for Web Applications in Hybrid Cloud (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Malware in UEFI/BIOS or device firmware survives OS reinstalls and disk replacements. Rare but devastating — detection needs firmware measurement (TPM attestation) and dedicated scanning, not standard AV. Applies to Web Applications in Hybrid Cloud at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- CHIPSEC or firmware-scanner findings of modified UEFI modules, unexpected DXE drivers, or Secure Boot disabled without authorization.
- TPM attestation failures or PCR values deviating from the known-good baseline for the hardware model.
- Persistence surviving full disk wipe and OS reinstall — the hallmark symptom.
- Lens: Best telemetry: app audit logs (with authenticated identity) + WAF logs + structured access logs. Unified SIEM ingesting both on-prem syslog and cloud audit trails with identity correlation across both.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Conditional-access and network logs covering the interconnect (ExpressRoute/Direct Connect/VPN).

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Application audit log: who did what to which object, with session IDs and source IPs and WAF block logs and anomaly scores; web-server access/error logs around the incident; run `grep -E ' 4[0-9]{2} | 5[0-9]{2} ' /var/log/nginx/access.log | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -15` then `journalctl -u myapp --since '2 hours ago' | grep -iE 'error|unauthor|exception' | tail -30`.
3. **Analyze.** Dump the firmware image (with authorization) and diff against the vendor's known-good image for the exact board and version. Then: Determine the implant's capabilities: network, persistence mechanism, and whether it targets other hosts (some spread via firmware update mechanisms).
4. **Contain and harden.** Enable Secure Boot + TPM measured boot fleet-wide; lock BIOS with admin passwords and signed firmware updates only. Asset layer: Authorization checks on every object reference, output encoding, parameterized queries, secure session handling. Environment layer: Consistent identity (single IdP) across on-prem and cloud; no parallel credential stores.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Reinstalling the OS repeatedly while the firmware implant re-infects each build.
- Running firmware scans from the potentially compromised OS — use offline/BIOS-level tooling.
