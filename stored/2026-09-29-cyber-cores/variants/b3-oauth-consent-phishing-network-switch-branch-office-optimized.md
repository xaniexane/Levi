# OAuth Consent Phishing Defense for Network Switches in Branch Offices (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Users grant a malicious app OAuth permissions, giving the attacker persistent API access to mailbox, files, or directory — no password needed, survives password resets, invisible in logon logs. Applies to Network Switches in Branch Offices at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- New enterprise app registrations or OAuth consent grants for apps with vague names, especially requesting Mail.Read or Files.ReadWrite.All.
- Consent grants by users outside any change process, or apps verified by unknown publishers.
- API-driven mailbox/file access patterns (Graph API) with no corresponding interactive logon.
- Lens: Best telemetry: syslog (port up/down, STP changes, config changes) + SNMP/NetFlow + NAC logs. SD-WAN/branch firewall logs forwarded centrally; local DHCP/DNS logs for device attribution.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NAC or port-level logs identifying which device was on which port during the incident.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Syslog: link-state changes, MAC flaps, STP topology changes, login attempts and MAC address tables and ARP tables for device-to-port mapping during incidents; run `show mac address-table | include <suspect-mac>` then `show logging | include %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP|%PORT_SECURITY`.
3. **Analyze.** Inventory every permission the malicious app holds and every API call it made — the data accessed defines the breach. Then: Check for admin-consent abuse: was the app granted tenant-wide access by a compromised admin?
4. **Contain and harden.** Require admin consent for third-party apps; maintain an allowlist of approved publishers. Asset layer: Port security / 802.1X on access ports, BPDU guard, DHCP snooping + dynamic ARP inspection. Environment layer: Standardized branch firewall policy deployed as code; no local admin exceptions.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Resetting the user's password and declaring victory while the OAuth grant keeps working.
- Overlooking that the app may have been granted access by an ADMIN — scope tenant-wide, not per-user.
