# MFA Fatigue Attack Defense for DNS Servers in Remote Workforce (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers with a stolen password spam push notifications until the victim approves one out of annoyance or confusion. The defense is push hygiene: number matching, context display, and rate limits on prompts. Applies to DNS Servers in Remote Workforce at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- Dozens of MFA push prompts to one user in minutes, especially at odd hours, followed by a single approval.
- An approval immediately followed by session activity from an unusual IP or device enrollment changes.
- Helpdesk reports of users 'getting lots of MFA prompts' in the days before the incident.
- Lens: Best telemetry: query logs (or passive DNS) + zone-transfer/change audit + resolver cache stats. EDR on every endpoint as the primary sensor (no corporate network tap for remote hosts).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to VPN/ZTNA access logs and SaaS/IdP sign-in logs as the network-visibility substitute.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in DNS query logs showing tunneling/DGA patterns; zone files and their change history and Zone-transfer (AXFR) request logs; DNSSEC validation failure logs; run `grep -E '.{60,}' /var/log/named/query.log | tail -20   # long labels: tunneling/DGA` then `rndc status; echo ---; journalctl -u named --since '1 hour ago' | grep -iE 'transfer|denied|error' | tail -15`.
3. **Analyze.** Reconstruct the prompt storm: count, timing, and the approving event — then inventory the attacker's post-approval actions. Then: Check whether the attacker registered a new MFA method during the session (persistence via second factor).
4. **Contain and harden.** Number matching on all push MFA, show login context (app, location), and rate-limit prompts per user. Asset layer: Restrict recursion to internal clients, block outbound port 53 except resolvers, DNSSEC validation on. Environment layer: Zero-trust access: device compliance + MFA per application, not per network.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Assuming an approved push means a legitimate user — approval is exactly what the attacker engineered.
- Not checking for newly registered MFA methods, which survive password resets.
