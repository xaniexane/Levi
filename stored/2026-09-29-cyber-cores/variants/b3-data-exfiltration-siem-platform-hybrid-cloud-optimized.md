# Data Exfiltration Defense for SIEM Platforms in Hybrid Cloud (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Sensitive data leaving the network — the moment an intrusion becomes a breach. Quantifying WHAT left is more important than blocking the channel after the fact; notification obligations depend on the data, not the technique. Applies to SIEM Platforms in Hybrid Cloud at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- Egress spikes: large uploads to external hosts, cloud storage, or paste sites from servers that normally receive more than they send.
- Staging activity: large archives (zip/7z/rar) created in temp directories, database dumps, or mailbox exports shortly before the transfer.
- DLP alerts on regulated data patterns (SSN, card numbers, PHI formats) in outbound traffic, or DNS/ICMP exfil at low volume.
- Lens: Best telemetry: ingestion health metrics + rule-hit history + analyst audit trail. Unified SIEM ingesting both on-prem syslog and cloud audit trails with identity correlation across both.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Conditional-access and network logs covering the interconnect (ExpressRoute/Direct Connect/VPN).

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Detection rule hit history for the incident's indicators across the full retention window and Ingestion gap reports: which sources stopped logging and when (coverage blind spots); run `# conceptually (SIEM query languages differ):` then `index=* <indicator> earliest=-30d | stats count by sourcetype`.
3. **Analyze.** Reconstruct the exfil set: source paths, file types, record counts, and data classification — involve legal early for notification scoping. Then: Preserve full packet/proxy logs of the transfer; they prove what left and are evidence for regulators and law enforcement.
4. **Contain and harden.** DLP policies with blocking on bulk sensitive-data egress, plus alerting on archive creation and database dump commands. Asset layer: Separate SIEM admin credentials, tamper-evident storage, monitored ingestion pipelines. Environment layer: Consistent identity (single IdP) across on-prem and cloud; no parallel credential stores.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Stopping the transfer but never determining what was in it — you cannot scope a breach on 'we blocked something'.
- Forgetting cloud audit logs: exfil via sanctioned SaaS (personal Drive, Dropbox) bypasses network DLP.
