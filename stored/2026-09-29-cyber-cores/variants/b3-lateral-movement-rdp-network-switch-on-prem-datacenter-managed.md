# RDP Lateral Movement Defense for Network Switches in On-Premises Datacenter (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

RDP is both an admin tool and the attacker's favorite lateral highway. Compromised credentials plus unrestricted RDP equals domain-wide movement that looks almost legitimate in the logs. Applies to Network Switches in On-Premises Datacenter at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- 4624 type-10 (RDP) logons from a workstation to servers or other workstations outside the user's normal admin pattern.
- RDP sessions at unusual hours, from hosts the account never logged into before, or with clipboard/drive redirection moving tools onto the target.
- TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager events (21/25) on targets without a matching helpdesk ticket or change record.
- Lens: Best telemetry: syslog (port up/down, STP changes, config changes) + SNMP/NetFlow + NAC logs. Full network tap/SPAN coverage at core and distribution layers feeding IDS and full-packet capture.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Centralized syslog from all infrastructure with NTP-synced timestamps for cross-device correlation.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Syslog: link-state changes, MAC flaps, STP topology changes, login attempts and MAC address tables and ARP tables for device-to-port mapping during incidents; run `show mac address-table | include <suspect-mac>` then `show logging | include %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP|%PORT_SECURITY`.
3. **Analyze.** Correlate RDP logons with the source host's compromise timeline to distinguish attacker sessions from legitimate admin work. Then: Check for credential harvesting on each RDP target: LSASS access or SAM reads following the session indicate theft.
4. **Contain and harden.** RDP restricted to jump hosts/bastions with MFA; Network Level Authentication enforced; no direct workstation-to-server RDP. Asset layer: Port security / 802.1X on access ports, BPDU guard, DHCP snooping + dynamic ARP inspection. Environment layer: Physical access controls with badge logs correlatable to logical access during investigations.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Allowing 'temporary' RDP exceptions that become permanent lateral paths.
- Missing RDP-based movement because you only hunted SMB — attackers use whatever is open.
