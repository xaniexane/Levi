# Kerberoasting Defense for EDR Consoles in Branch Offices (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers request service tickets for SPN accounts and crack them offline to recover service-account passwords — no alerts on the DC, because requesting tickets is normal. The defense is making those passwords uncrackable and the requests visible. Applies to EDR Consoles in Branch Offices at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- A single account requesting an unusual number of service tickets (4769) with RC4 encryption for many different SPNs in a short window.
- Ticket requests for SPNs from accounts with no business need, or requests at odd hours from a workstation (not a server).
- Subsequent use of a cracked service account: logons from unexpected hosts or privilege changes for that account.
- Lens: Best telemetry: raw process/network telemetry + detection history + sensor health inventory. SD-WAN/branch firewall logs forwarded centrally; local DHCP/DNS logs for device attribution.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NAC or port-level logs identifying which device was on which port during the incident.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Full process trees with command lines, hashes, and network connections for suspect hosts and Detection and response action history (isolations, kills, quarantines); run `# conceptually (EDR APIs differ):` then `edr-cli hunt process --hostname <host> --since 24h --tree`.
3. **Analyze.** List every SPN targeted and assess the crackability of each service account's password (length, complexity, age). Then: If a service account was cracked, treat it as full compromise: inventory everything that account could touch.
4. **Contain and harden.** Service accounts: 25+ character random passwords, or better, group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) with automatic rotation. Asset layer: Tamper protection locked with console-only disable, auto-isolation policies for high-severity detections. Environment layer: Standardized branch firewall policy deployed as code; no local admin exceptions.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Rotating the password but leaving the SPN on a weak account — the attacker just roasts it again.
- Missing that the cracked service account may have been used to request MORE tickets (roast chaining).
