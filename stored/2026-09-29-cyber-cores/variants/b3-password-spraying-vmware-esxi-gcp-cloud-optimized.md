# Password Spraying Defense for VMware ESXi Hosts in GCP Cloud (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers try a small set of common passwords against many usernames, staying under per-account lockout thresholds. It is quieter than stuffing and specifically tuned to evade lockout policies, often running for days or weeks. Applies to VMware ESXi Hosts in GCP Cloud at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- A handful of failed logons per account (1-3) spread across hundreds of accounts from one or a few IPs, repeating on a schedule — the classic low-and-slow pattern.
- The same few passwords attempted everywhere (SeasonYear!, Company123, Password1); check by aggregating failed-logon password hashes where your IdP logs them.
- Spray bursts correlated with newly published password lists or timed to holidays/weekends when response is slower.
- Lens: Best telemetry: vCenter tasks/events + ESXi syslog + lockdown-mode audit. Cloud Audit Logs (admin + data access) exported to a locked-down logging project.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Security Command Center findings and VPC flow logs centralized.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in vCenter tasks and events (VM power ops, snapshot create/delete, host profile changes) and ESXi hostd/vpxa logs and shell-access records; VM .vmx changes; run `esxcli system auditrecords local list | tail -20` then `vim-cmd vmsvc/getallvms 2>/dev/null | head -20`.
3. **Analyze.** Reconstruct the spray window: first-seen to last-seen per source IP, and list every account with even one success inside the window — those are confirmed or suspected takeovers. Then: Check whether sprayed accounts share traits (same OU, same onboarding batch, service accounts) to find how the username list was built.
4. **Contain and harden.** Smart lockout (soft lockout with increasing delays) plus alerting on distributed low-volume failures, not just lockouts. Asset layer: Lockdown mode on, isolated management network, unique per-host root passwords, MFA on vCenter. Environment layer: Organization policies constraining public exposure, API enablement, and service-account key creation.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Per-account lockout thresholds alone will not catch spraying; you need cross-account velocity detection.
- Treating one success as an isolated incident misses the campaign — always scope the full spray window.
