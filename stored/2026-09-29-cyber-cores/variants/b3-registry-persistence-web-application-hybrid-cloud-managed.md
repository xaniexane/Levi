# Registry Persistence Defense for Web Applications in Hybrid Cloud (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Run keys, services, Winlogon helpers, and COM hijacks give attackers reboot-surviving execution with minimal footprint. Baseline the autoruns on gold images; alert on deviations, not on the mechanism's existence. Applies to Web Applications in Hybrid Cloud at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- Writes to Run/RunOnce keys, Winlogon Userinit/Shell values, or service ImagePath entries pointing at unusual binaries.
- Sysmon event 13 (registry value set) on autorun locations by non-installer processes, or new services with suspicious binaries.
- Autoruns deltas: new entries appearing between baseline scans on hosts with no software-change record.
- Lens: Best telemetry: app audit logs (with authenticated identity) + WAF logs + structured access logs. Unified SIEM ingesting both on-prem syslog and cloud audit trails with identity correlation across both.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Conditional-access and network logs covering the interconnect (ExpressRoute/Direct Connect/VPN).

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Application audit log: who did what to which object, with session IDs and source IPs and WAF block logs and anomaly scores; web-server access/error logs around the incident; run `grep -E ' 4[0-9]{2} | 5[0-9]{2} ' /var/log/nginx/access.log | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -15` then `journalctl -u myapp --since '2 hours ago' | grep -iE 'error|unauthor|exception' | tail -30`.
3. **Analyze.** Capture the referenced binary: hash, signature, and sandbox detonation to confirm malicious intent. Then: Check the same autorun locations across the fleet — registry persistence is often deployed identically to many hosts.
4. **Contain and harden.** Scheduled Autoruns/Sysmon baselining with alerting on new persistence entries; restrict registry write rights for standard users. Asset layer: Authorization checks on every object reference, output encoding, parameterized queries, secure session handling. Environment layer: Consistent identity (single IdP) across on-prem and cloud; no parallel credential stores.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Cleaning the registry value while the dropper that restores it still runs on a schedule.
- Overlooking user-hive (HKCU) persistence during a 'system-only' triage.
