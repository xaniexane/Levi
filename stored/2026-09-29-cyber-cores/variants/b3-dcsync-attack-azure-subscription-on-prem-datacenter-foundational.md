# DCSync Attack Defense for Azure Subscriptions in On-Premises Datacenter (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

With replication rights, an attacker impersonates a domain controller and pulls password hashes for ANY account — including krbtgt — via normal replication traffic. It looks like DC-to-DC chatter, which is why it evades naive monitoring. Applies to Azure Subscriptions in On-Premises Datacenter at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- 4662 (directory object access) on the domain root or krbtgt account by a principal that is not a real domain controller.
- Replication traffic (DRS) originating from a non-DC host, or a DC requesting replication far outside the normal schedule.
- Newly granted DS-Replication-Get-Changes rights (especially Get-Changes-All) to users, groups, or computers.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Activity Log + Entra sign-in logs + Defender for Cloud + NSG flow logs. Full network tap/SPAN coverage at core and distribution layers feeding IDS and full-packet capture.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Centralized syslog from all infrastructure with NTP-synced timestamps for cross-device correlation.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Azure Activity Log (write/delete on IAM, policy, network) and Entra audit/sign-in logs and Defender for Cloud recommendations and alerts; resource-change history; run `az monitor activity-log list --max-events 25 --query '[].{time:eventTimestamp, op:operationName.value, caller:caller}' -o table` then `az security alert list --query '[].{name:alertDisplayName, severity:severity, time:timeGeneratedUtc}' -o table`.
3. **Analyze.** Identify which account performed the sync and which hashes were pulled — a krbtgt pull means the entire domain's Kerberos trust must be reset (double krbtgt rotation). Then: Review how the attacker gained replication rights: compromised admin, delegated rights sprawl, or ACL abuse.
4. **Contain and harden.** Audit and strip replication rights to the minimum; alert on any grant of Get-Changes-All. Asset layer: Azure Policy deny-effects on public storage/exposure; PIM for subscription roles; Defender plans on. Environment layer: Physical access controls with badge logs correlatable to logical access during investigations.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Resetting user passwords but not the krbtgt — golden tickets forged from a stolen krbtgt survive password resets.
- Missing that DCSync needs only replication rights, not Domain Admin — delegated-rights sprawl is the usual enabler.
