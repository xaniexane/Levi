# Credential Stuffing Defense for SSO Identity Providers in Azure Cloud (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers replay username/password pairs stolen from third-party breaches against your login endpoints, betting on password reuse. It shows up as high-volume failed logons from distributed IPs, occasionally followed by a small number of successful takeovers. Applies to SSO Identity Providers in Azure Cloud at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- Authentication logs show a spike in failed logons (often 100s per minute) from many source IPs against a single login endpoint, with a low success rate and common password patterns.
- Successful logons immediately followed by password or MFA changes, mailbox rule creation, or impossible-travel alerts for the same account within minutes.
- WAF/bot-management flags distributed requests with identical user-agent strings, headless-browser markers, or known credential-stuffing tool signatures.
- Lens: Best telemetry: authentication logs with MFA detail + app-assignment changes + federation trust changes. Activity Log and Entra sign-in/audit logs streamed to Log Analytics/SIEM; Defender for Cloud alerts.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NSG flow logs and storage analytics for data-plane visibility.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Authentication logs per application (success/failure, MFA method, device, location) and Application assignment and provisioning logs; new SSO integrations; run `# conceptually (IdP APIs differ):` then `idp-cli logs auth --user <upn> --last 7d --format table | head -25`.
3. **Analyze.** Separate spray from stuffing: stuffing reuses many passwords per username from breach corpora; confirm by checking whether the attempted passwords appear in public breach datasets. Then: For each successful post-stuffing logon, inventory session actions: read mail rules, forwarding addresses, OAuth grants, and API keys created in the 24 hours after compromise.
4. **Contain and harden.** Enforce MFA everywhere and block legacy/basic authentication; stuffing dies against phishing-resistant MFA. Asset layer: Phishing-resistant MFA default, sign-on policies per app risk, session lifetime limits. Environment layer: Azure Policy deny-effects on risky configurations; PIM-gated subscription roles.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Blocking single IPs is whack-a-mole against botnets; block on behavior (velocity, fingerprint) rather than address.
- Forcing a fleet-wide password reset without confirming which accounts were actually taken over burns goodwill and teaches users to pick weaker passwords.
