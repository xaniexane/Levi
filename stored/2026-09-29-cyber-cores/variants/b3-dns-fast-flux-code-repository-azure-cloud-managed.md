# DNS Fast-Flux Defense for Code Repositories in Azure Cloud (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Fast-flux networks rotate DNS answers across many compromised hosts every few minutes, making malicious infrastructure hard to takedown. Defenders detect the flux pattern itself: low TTLs, high answer churn, and geographically scattered A records. Applies to Code Repositories in Azure Cloud at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- DNS answers with TTLs under 300 seconds rotating across dozens of IPs in unrelated ASNs and countries for a single domain.
- Short-lived domains (registered days ago) resolving to residential or compromised-server IPs with no legitimate business relationship.
- Endpoint connections to flux domains correlating with malware detonations or phishing kit infrastructure.
- Lens: Best telemetry: push/audit logs + secret-scanning alerts + branch-protection change history. Activity Log and Entra sign-in/audit logs streamed to Log Analytics/SIEM; Defender for Cloud alerts.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NSG flow logs and storage analytics for data-plane visibility.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Push logs (who pushed what to which branch), force-push and history-rewrite records and Secret-scanning and code-scanning alerts with their resolution state; run `git log --since='7 days ago' --format='%h %an %ad %s' --date=short | head -30` then `git log --all --diff-filter=A -- '*secret*' '*credential*' '*key*' --format='%h %an %s' | head -20`.
3. **Analyze.** Profile the flux: record TTL, unique IPs per hour, ASN/country spread, and name-server patterns to fingerprint the specific flux service or kit. Then: Pivot from the domain to find sibling infrastructure: shared name servers, registration patterns, and certificate overlaps.
4. **Contain and harden.** DNS response policy zones (RPZ) blocking confirmed flux domains, plus alerting on sub-300s TTL answers at the resolver. Asset layer: Branch protection with required reviews, signed commits, push protection for secrets. Environment layer: Azure Policy deny-effects on risky configurations; PIM-gated subscription roles.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Blocking individual flux IPs — they churn in minutes; block the domain pattern and the detection logic instead.
- Confusing legitimate CDN behavior (low TTL, many IPs) with flux; require the ASN-scatter plus short-domain-age combination.
