# Watering Hole Attack Defense for CI/CD Runners in Colocation Facilities (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers compromise websites your targets frequent, turning trusted browsing into infection. Detection is epidemiological: multiple infections sharing one browsing history overlap. Applies to CI/CD Runners in Colocation Facilities at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- Several hosts infected with the same payload whose proxy histories share a common site visited shortly before each infection.
- A trusted industry/partner site serving malicious scripts or redirects (verified via sandbox fetch).
- Infections clustered by department or role matching the compromised site's audience.
- Lens: Best telemetry: job execution logs + runner registration events + secret-access audit. Customer-owned network taps and logging (the colo provider's logs are out of scope — verify contractually).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Badge/physical access logs from the facility correlated with remote-hand ticket times.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Job logs with executed commands and exit codes for suspect runs and Runner registration/deregistration events and runner version inventory; run `runner-cli jobs list --status failed --last 7d | head -20` then `runner-cli runners list --format table`.
3. **Analyze.** Confirm the watering hole by fetching the suspect site in a sandbox and capturing the injected code. Then: Enumerate all visitors to the site in the compromise window — the exposed population, not just the infected.
4. **Contain and harden.** Notify the site owner; block the malicious URLs/paths (not necessarily the whole domain) at the proxy. Asset layer: Ephemeral isolated runners, OIDC short-lived credentials, no persistent secrets on runners. Environment layer: Locked cabinets, private cages, and escort policies for remote hands.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Treating each infection as independent and missing the common source — always compare browsing histories across cases.
- Blocking the entire legitimate domain permanently instead of the injected path, breaking business access.
