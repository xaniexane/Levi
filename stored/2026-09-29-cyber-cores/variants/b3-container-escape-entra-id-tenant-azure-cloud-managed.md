# Container Escape Defense for Microsoft Entra ID Tenants in Azure Cloud (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

A compromised container breaks out to the host via privileged mode, hostPath mounts, or kernel exploits — turning one application breach into full node control. Harden the container boundary and monitor for escape primitives. Applies to Microsoft Entra ID Tenants in Azure Cloud at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- Containers running privileged or with hostPath mounts to sensitive host paths, especially created outside normal deployments.
- Host-level processes spawned by container runtimes, or unexpected writes to host paths from container contexts.
- Kernel exploit artifacts or abuse of host namespaces (nsenter-style) inside container workloads.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Entra sign-in + audit logs streamed to Log Analytics/SIEM with 30+ day retention. Activity Log and Entra sign-in/audit logs streamed to Log Analytics/SIEM; Defender for Cloud alerts.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NSG flow logs and storage analytics for data-plane visibility.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Sign-in logs (interactive, non-interactive, service principal) with risk detections and MFA details and Audit logs: app registrations, consent grants, Conditional Access changes, role assignments; run `# Microsoft Graph (delegated admin): recent risky sign-ins` then `Get-MgAuditLogSignIn -Filter "riskState eq 'atRisk'" -Top 25 | Select-Object CreatedDateTime, UserPrincipalName, IpAddress, @{n='Risk';e={$_.RiskDetail}}`.
3. **Analyze.** Determine the escape primitive: misconfiguration (privileged, hostPath, hostPID) versus kernel CVE — the fix differs. Then: Assess node compromise: if escaped, the node is hostile — cordon, drain, and rebuild it; do not trust in-place cleaning.
4. **Contain and harden.** Never run privileged containers; drop capabilities, use read-only root filesystems, and enforce via admission controllers (OPA/Kyverno). Asset layer: Conditional Access: require phishing-resistant MFA, compliant devices, block legacy auth and risky sign-ins. Environment layer: Azure Policy deny-effects on risky configurations; PIM-gated subscription roles.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Rebuilding the container while the compromised node keeps serving the attacker's workloads.
- Assuming non-privileged means safe — hostPath mounts and capabilities can be equally fatal.
