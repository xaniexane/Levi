# Golden Ticket Attack Defense for Email Gateways in AWS Cloud (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Forged Kerberos TGTs using the stolen krbtgt hash grant unrestricted, long-lived domain access that survives password resets. Detection relies on ticket anomalies: impossible lifetimes, wrong encryption, or logons that bypass the DC. Applies to Email Gateways in AWS Cloud at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- TGTs with lifetimes far exceeding domain policy (e.g., 10 years), RC4-encrypted tickets in an AES-enforced domain, or tickets for accounts that never authenticated (no 4768).
- 4769 service-ticket requests referencing a TGT the DC never issued, or logons from hosts with no corresponding interactive session.
- The krbtgt account's own anomalous activity following a DCSync event.
- Lens: Best telemetry: message-tracking logs + sandbox verdicts + URL-rewrite click logs. Organization CloudTrail in all regions, GuardDuty, and VPC flow logs shipped to the security account.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to CloudWatch and workload logs centralized; S3 access logging on sensitive buckets.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Message tracking (sender, recipients, subject hash, attachments, verdicts) for the campaign window and Sandbox detonation reports for attachments/URLs; quarantined message copies; run `# conceptually (gateway CLIs differ):` then `message-tracking --sender <suspect-domain> --last 7d`.
3. **Analyze.** Confirm via ticket inspection (klist, network capture): lifetime, encryption type, and client name mismatches prove forgery. Then: Scope everything done under forged tickets — assume full domain compromise until proven otherwise.
4. **Contain and harden.** Rotate the krbtgt password TWICE (to invalidate both current and previous hash) after any suspected compromise. Asset layer: Sandbox detonation for all attachments/links, DMARC p=reject on owned domains, banner external mail. Environment layer: SCPs as guardrails (deny leaving org, deny disabling logging, region restrictions).
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Rotating krbtgt only once — the N-1 hash remains valid and the golden ticket still works.
- Treating it as an account incident instead of a domain-trust incident; the response scope is the whole forest.
