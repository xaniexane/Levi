# Web Session Hijacking Defense for SaaS Applications in Branch Offices (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Stolen session cookies let attackers ride authenticated web sessions without credentials or MFA. Cookie theft via infostealer or XSS is the usual source; concurrent-session anomalies are the usual signal. Applies to SaaS Applications in Branch Offices at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- The same session active from two geographies or ASNs simultaneously, or a session suddenly continuing from a datacenter IP.
- Session created without a fresh authentication event (cookie replay), or user-agent/IP changing mid-session.
- Infostealer execution on the user's device shortly before the anomalous session.
- Lens: Best telemetry: SaaS audit logs (admin + user activity) streamed to SIEM + SSO logs. SD-WAN/branch firewall logs forwarded centrally; local DHCP/DNS logs for device attribution.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NAC or port-level logs identifying which device was on which port during the incident.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Admin audit log (settings changes, user provisioning, sharing changes) and User activity logs: file access, downloads, external sharing events; run `# conceptually (SaaS APIs differ):` then `saas-cli audit log --category admin --last 7d --format table | head -25`.
3. **Analyze.** Determine the theft vector: device compromise (cookie files exfiltrated) versus application XSS — the fix differs. Then: Inventory actions taken in the hijacked session: data viewed, settings changed, transactions performed.
4. **Contain and harden.** Short session lifetimes, binding sessions to device/IP characteristics, and step-up auth for sensitive actions. Asset layer: SSO with MFA enforced, SCIM provisioning, least-privilege roles, external-sharing restricted. Environment layer: Standardized branch firewall policy deployed as code; no local admin exceptions.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Invalidating the password but not the session — the hijacker stays logged in.
- Missing that the user's DEVICE is compromised; the next session gets stolen too until the infostealer is removed.
