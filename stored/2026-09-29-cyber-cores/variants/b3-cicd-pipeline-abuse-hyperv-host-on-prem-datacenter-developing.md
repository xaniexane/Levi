# CI/CD Pipeline Abuse Defense for Hyper-V Hosts in On-Premises Datacenter (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Compromised build pipelines inject malicious code into artifacts or exfiltrate secrets from build environments. Pipelines hold production credentials AND ship code — treat them as tier-zero assets. Applies to Hyper-V Hosts in On-Premises Datacenter at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- Pipeline runs triggered outside normal commits, modified build scripts, or runners executing unexpected network calls.
- Secrets accessed by pipeline jobs that never needed them, or new pipeline variables containing exfil endpoints.
- Artifacts whose hashes differ from reproducible-build expectations.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Hyper-V-VMMS/Hyper-V-Worker event logs + host Security log + SCVMM job history. Full network tap/SPAN coverage at core and distribution layers feeding IDS and full-packet capture.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Centralized syslog from all infrastructure with NTP-synced timestamps for cross-device correlation.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Microsoft-Windows-Hyper-V-VMMS event log (VM create/start/stop, checkpoint ops) and Virtual switch and virtual NIC configuration; VM configuration files and checkpoints; run `Get-WinEvent -LogName 'Microsoft-Windows-Hyper-V-VMMS-Admin' -MaxEvents 25 | Select-Object TimeCreated, Id, Message | Format-Table -Wrap` then `Get-VM | Select-Object Name, State, CheckpointType, @{n='Switch';e={(Get-VMNetworkAdapter $_).SwitchName}} | Format-Table`.
3. **Analyze.** Diff the pipeline definition against the last known-good version; identify exactly which jobs were tampered with. Then: Determine which secrets the compromised jobs could read and rotate all of them — assume exposure.
4. **Contain and harden.** Pipeline definitions in version control with required reviews; ephemeral, isolated runners; OIDC-based short-lived credentials instead of stored secrets. Asset layer: Dedicated management NIC/vLAN, Shielded VMs for sensitive workloads, guarded fabric where available. Environment layer: Physical access controls with badge logs correlatable to logical access during investigations.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Cleaning the pipeline but shipping artifacts it already poisoned — quarantine recent builds.
- Long-lived cloud credentials stored as pipeline secrets; rotate and replace with OIDC federation.
