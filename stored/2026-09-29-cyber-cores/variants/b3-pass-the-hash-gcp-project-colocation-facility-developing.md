# Pass-the-Hash Defense for GCP Projects in Colocation Facilities (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Stolen NTLM hashes authenticate without the password ever being cracked. It is invisible to password monitoring because no password is used — defense means killing NTLM where possible and watching for its telltale logon patterns. Applies to GCP Projects in Colocation Facilities at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- 4624 type-3/9 logons using NTLM where Kerberos is expected, especially from workstations to servers with admin accounts.
- Logon sessions with no interactive activity but successful authentication, or the same hash authenticating from multiple hosts simultaneously.
- NTLM audit logs showing authentication for accounts that should be Kerberos-only.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Cloud Audit Logs (Admin Activity + Data Access) + Security Command Center + VPC flow logs. Customer-owned network taps and logging (the colo provider's logs are out of scope — verify contractually).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Badge/physical access logs from the facility correlated with remote-hand ticket times.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Cloud Audit Logs: setIamPolicy, storage.setIamPermissions, compute inserts, and console logons and Security Command Center findings; Forseti/Config Validator drift reports where deployed; run `gcloud logging read 'protoPayload.methodName:"SetIamPolicy"' --limit 20 --format='table(timestamp, protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail, resourceName)'` then `gcloud scc findings list organizations/$ORG_ID --filter='state="ACTIVE"' --limit 15`.
3. **Analyze.** Determine hash source: LSASS dump, SAM extraction, or DCSync — each implies a different prior compromise to remediate. Then: List every host the hash authenticated to; each is a foothold until reimaged or verified clean.
4. **Contain and harden.** Reduce NTLM usage (audit mode first, then restrict), deploy Credential Guard, and use unique local admin passwords (LAPS). Asset layer: Organization policies: no public buckets, no default SA use, OS Login on; deny unapproved APIs. Environment layer: Locked cabinets, private cages, and escort policies for remote hands.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Resetting the password without considering that the attacker may have dumped the NEW hash too if still present.
- Disabling NTLM blindly and breaking legacy apps — audit first, restrict second.
