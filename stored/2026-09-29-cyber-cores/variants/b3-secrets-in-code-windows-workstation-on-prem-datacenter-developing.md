# Secrets in Code Defense for Windows Workstations in On-Premises Datacenter (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

API keys, passwords, and tokens committed to repositories get scraped by attackers (and by every future repo reader). A committed secret is a compromised secret — rotate first, clean history second. Applies to Windows Workstations in On-Premises Datacenter at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- Secret-scanning alerts (push protection or historical scan) flagging keys, tokens, or private keys in commits.
- Anomalous API usage billed to a key that appears in a repository, or commits adding '.env' files.
- Public repository exposure: any secret ever pushed public is considered harvested.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Sysmon + EDR + PowerShell script-block logging forwarded to the SIEM. Full network tap/SPAN coverage at core and distribution layers feeding IDS and full-packet capture.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Centralized syslog from all infrastructure with NTP-synced timestamps for cross-device correlation.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Security event log (4624/4625 logons, 4688 process creation, 7045 service installs) and Sysmon operational log and PowerShell operational log (4104 script blocks); run `Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; Id=4625} -MaxEvents 50 | Format-List TimeCreated, @{n='TargetUser';e={$_.Properties[5].Value}}, @{n='SourceIP';e={$_.Properties[19].Value}}` then `autorunsc64.exe -accepteula -a * -c -h -s -t | findstr /v "Microsoft Corporation"`.
3. **Analyze.** For each exposed secret: determine its privileges and check usage logs for unauthorized use since exposure. Then: Check git history depth: secrets in old commits are still exposed to anyone with repo access.
4. **Contain and harden.** Rotate the secret FIRST, then purge from history; enable push protection and pre-commit secret scanning. Asset layer: Application allowlisting (WDAC/AppLocker) and LSA Protection + Credential Guard enabled. Environment layer: Physical access controls with badge logs correlatable to logical access during investigations.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Deleting the commit without rotating — the secret is already copied.
- Scanning only main branch; secrets hide in feature branches, PRs, and forks.
