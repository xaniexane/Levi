# Cloud Console Takeover Defense for Linux Workstations in Colocation Facilities (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

Stolen cloud credentials used in the web console give attackers point-and-click infrastructure control. Console logons from unusual locations followed by IAM changes are the classic takeover sequence. Applies to Linux Workstations in Colocation Facilities at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- CloudTrail/Entra sign-in logs showing console logons from new countries or anonymizing services for privileged users.
- IAM policy changes, new access keys, or new users created within minutes of the anomalous logon.
- Disabling of CloudTrail/logging or deletion of log data — the attacker covering tracks.
- Lens: Best telemetry: auditd user-session logging + EDR agent + desktop shell histories (with user notice). Customer-owned network taps and logging (the colo provider's logs are out of scope — verify contractually).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Badge/physical access logs from the facility correlated with remote-hand ticket times.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in User shell histories (~/.bash_history), desktop autostart entries (~/.config/autostart/) and auditd execve logs and USB device logs; browser profiles for web-vector cases; run `ls -la ~/.config/autostart/ 2>/dev/null; grep -r 'Exec=' ~/.config/autostart/ 2>/dev/null` then `sudo ausearch --start recent -m EXECVE -i | tail -30`.
3. **Analyze.** Reconstruct the full API call sequence after takeover: what was created, modified, exfiltrated, or destroyed. Then: Check for persistence: new IAM users, roles with trust policies pointing outward, or modified instance user-data.
4. **Contain and harden.** Phishing-resistant MFA on all console users, especially root/ break-glass; SCPs preventing logging disablement. Asset layer: Standard user accounts for daily work, full-disk encryption, and screen-lock enforcement. Environment layer: Locked cabinets, private cages, and escort policies for remote hands.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Rotating the compromised user's keys but missing the backdoor IAM role the attacker created.
- Trusting the account's own logs after the attacker had admin — verify against the immutable archive.
