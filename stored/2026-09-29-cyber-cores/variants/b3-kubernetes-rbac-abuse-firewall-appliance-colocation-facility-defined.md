# Kubernetes RBAC Abuse Defense for Firewall Appliances in Colocation Facilities (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Overly broad Kubernetes roles let attackers escalate from a compromised pod to cluster admin. RBAC misconfigurations are the Kubernetes equivalent of AD delegation sprawl — audit them the same way. Applies to Firewall Appliances in Colocation Facilities at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- Pods or service accounts using cluster-admin or wildcard roles, especially ones created outside GitOps pipelines.
- Kubernetes audit logs showing service accounts listing secrets cluster-wide or creating privileged pods.
- New ClusterRoleBindings granting powerful roles to default or application service accounts.
- Lens: Best telemetry: traffic/deny logs + admin audit log + config-change diffs shipped to SIEM. Customer-owned network taps and logging (the colo provider's logs are out of scope — verify contractually).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Badge/physical access logs from the facility correlated with remote-hand ticket times.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Traffic logs (allowed/denied with rule IDs), threat logs (IPS/AV verdicts), admin audit log and Configuration revisions and diffs; VPN session logs and authentication failures; run `# vendor CLIs differ; conceptually:` then `show log traffic query (source <suspect-ip>)             # Palo Alto style`.
3. **Analyze.** Map effective permissions per service account: which can read secrets, create pods, or exec into others — that is the blast radius. Then: Check whether the abused binding was created by the attacker or pre-existing misconfiguration.
4. **Contain and harden.** Least-privilege RBAC, no wildcards, no cluster-admin for apps; manage bindings via GitOps with PR review. Asset layer: Default-deny with documented rules, admin on dedicated interface with MFA, config backups versioned. Environment layer: Locked cabinets, private cages, and escort policies for remote hands.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Fixing the abused binding but leaving 50 other wildcard roles in place.
- Forgetting that a compromised pod with cloud credentials can pivot from k8s RBAC to cloud IAM.
