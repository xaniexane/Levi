# DNS Tunneling Defense for SIEM Platforms in Hybrid Cloud (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

DNS tunneling smuggles data or C2 inside DNS queries, abusing a protocol almost every network allows outbound. Detection hinges on query shape (length, entropy, volume, record types), not on blocklists. Applies to SIEM Platforms in Hybrid Cloud at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- Long, high-entropy subdomains (often 50+ chars) in DNS logs, unusual record types (TXT, NULL) at volume, or a single host generating thousands of queries to one domain.
- Beacon-like regularity in query timing to an obscure domain, or DNS queries for domains registered within the last 30 days.
- Responses with abnormally large TXT records relative to the query — data coming back down the tunnel.
- Lens: Best telemetry: ingestion health metrics + rule-hit history + analyst audit trail. Unified SIEM ingesting both on-prem syslog and cloud audit trails with identity correlation across both.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Conditional-access and network logs covering the interconnect (ExpressRoute/Direct Connect/VPN).

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Detection rule hit history for the incident's indicators across the full retention window and Ingestion gap reports: which sources stopped logging and when (coverage blind spots); run `# conceptually (SIEM query languages differ):` then `index=* <indicator> earliest=-30d | stats count by sourcetype`.
3. **Analyze.** Decode a sample of tunneled queries/responses in a sandbox to determine direction and content: C2 instructions, exfiltrated data, or both. Then: Identify patient zero by earliest query timestamp, then hunt laterally: tunneling tools are often deployed to multiple hosts.
4. **Contain and harden.** Force all DNS through logged, filtered resolvers; block direct port-53 egress from endpoints and alert on non-standard DNS ports. Asset layer: Separate SIEM admin credentials, tamper-evident storage, monitored ingestion pipelines. Environment layer: Consistent identity (single IdP) across on-prem and cloud; no parallel credential stores.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Blocking the domain without finding the implant — the attacker rotates domains faster than you blocklist.
- Ignoring DNS over HTTPS (DoH): tunneled traffic inside DoH is invisible to passive DNS monitoring — log at the endpoint.
