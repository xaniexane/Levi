# Web Session Hijacking Defense for VPN Gateways in Colocation Facilities (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

Stolen session cookies let attackers ride authenticated web sessions without credentials or MFA. Cookie theft via infostealer or XSS is the usual source; concurrent-session anomalies are the usual signal. Applies to VPN Gateways in Colocation Facilities at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- The same session active from two geographies or ASNs simultaneously, or a session suddenly continuing from a datacenter IP.
- Session created without a fresh authentication event (cookie replay), or user-agent/IP changing mid-session.
- Infostealer execution on the user's device shortly before the anomalous session.
- Lens: Best telemetry: authentication logs + session logs (user, IP, bytes, duration) + gateway patch state. Customer-owned network taps and logging (the colo provider's logs are out of scope — verify contractually).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Badge/physical access logs from the facility correlated with remote-hand ticket times.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in VPN auth logs (success/failure per user with source IPs), session tables with data volumes and Gateway admin audit log and firmware/patch version; client version inventory; run `# conceptually (vendor CLIs differ):` then `show vpn-sessiondb detail anyconnect | grep -E 'Username|Assigned IP|Login Time'`.
3. **Analyze.** Determine the theft vector: device compromise (cookie files exfiltrated) versus application XSS — the fix differs. Then: Inventory actions taken in the hijacked session: data viewed, settings changed, transactions performed.
4. **Contain and harden.** Short session lifetimes, binding sessions to device/IP characteristics, and step-up auth for sensitive actions. Asset layer: MFA on every VPN profile, device posture checks before granting access, gateway firmware patched urgently. Environment layer: Locked cabinets, private cages, and escort policies for remote hands.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Invalidating the password but not the session — the hijacker stays logged in.
- Missing that the user's DEVICE is compromised; the next session gets stolen too until the infostealer is removed.
