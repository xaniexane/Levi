# Web Session Hijacking Defense for Kubernetes Clusters in Remote Workforce (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Stolen session cookies let attackers ride authenticated web sessions without credentials or MFA. Cookie theft via infostealer or XSS is the usual source; concurrent-session anomalies are the usual signal. Applies to Kubernetes Clusters in Remote Workforce at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- The same session active from two geographies or ASNs simultaneously, or a session suddenly continuing from a datacenter IP.
- Session created without a fresh authentication event (cookie replay), or user-agent/IP changing mid-session.
- Infostealer execution on the user's device shortly before the anomalous session.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Kubernetes audit logs + container runtime logs + admission-controller denials. EDR on every endpoint as the primary sensor (no corporate network tap for remote hosts).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to VPN/ZTNA access logs and SaaS/IdP sign-in logs as the network-visibility substitute.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in API-server audit log (who created pods/bindings/secrets, from where) and Kubelet/container runtime logs and image pull histories per node; run `kubectl audit2rbac --filename=audit.log 2>/dev/null | head; kubectl get clusterrolebindings -o wide | head -20` then `kubectl get pods -A -o json | python3 -c "import json,sys; [print(p['metadata']['namespace'], p['metadata']['name'], p['spec'].get('hostNetwork'), p['spec'].get('hostPID')) for p in json.load(sys.stdin)['items']]" | head -30`.
3. **Analyze.** Determine the theft vector: device compromise (cookie files exfiltrated) versus application XSS — the fix differs. Then: Inventory actions taken in the hijacked session: data viewed, settings changed, transactions performed.
4. **Contain and harden.** Short session lifetimes, binding sessions to device/IP characteristics, and step-up auth for sensitive actions. Asset layer: Least-privilege RBAC, Pod Security Standards enforced, no privileged pods, image signing/verification. Environment layer: Zero-trust access: device compliance + MFA per application, not per network.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Invalidating the password but not the session — the hijacker stays logged in.
- Missing that the user's DEVICE is compromised; the next session gets stolen too until the infostealer is removed.
