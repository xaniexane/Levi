# Pass-the-Hash Defense for IDS/IPS Sensors in Colocation Facilities (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Stolen NTLM hashes authenticate without the password ever being cracked. It is invisible to password monitoring because no password is used — defense means killing NTLM where possible and watching for its telltale logon patterns. Applies to IDS/IPS Sensors in Colocation Facilities at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- 4624 type-3/9 logons using NTLM where Kerberos is expected, especially from workstations to servers with admin accounts.
- Logon sessions with no interactive activity but successful authentication, or the same hash authenticating from multiple hosts simultaneously.
- NTLM audit logs showing authentication for accounts that should be Kerberos-only.
- Lens: Best telemetry: alert logs with full packet captures for high-severity events + sensor health metrics. Customer-owned network taps and logging (the colo provider's logs are out of scope — verify contractually).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Badge/physical access logs from the facility correlated with remote-hand ticket times.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Signature alert logs with triggering packet payloads; anomaly-detection baselines and deviations and PCAP ring buffers for incident windows; sensor placement/coverage maps; run `# Suricata/Snort style triage:` then `jq -c 'select(.alert.severity<=2) | {ts:.timestamp, sig:.alert.signature, src:.src_ip, dst:.dest_ip}' /var/log/suricata/eve.json | tail -20`.
3. **Analyze.** Determine hash source: LSASS dump, SAM extraction, or DCSync — each implies a different prior compromise to remediate. Then: List every host the hash authenticated to; each is a foothold until reimaged or verified clean.
4. **Contain and harden.** Reduce NTLM usage (audit mode first, then restrict), deploy Credential Guard, and use unique local admin passwords (LAPS). Asset layer: Sensors on SPAN/TAP at every trust boundary; signature sets auto-updated; TLS inspection feeding sensors. Environment layer: Locked cabinets, private cages, and escort policies for remote hands.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Resetting the password without considering that the attacker may have dumped the NEW hash too if still present.
- Disabling NTLM blindly and breaking legacy apps — audit first, restrict second.
