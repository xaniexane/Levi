# Scheduled Task Persistence Defense for Mobile Devices (MDM) in Colocation Facilities (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Scheduled tasks are the most common Windows persistence: they survive reboots, run as SYSTEM, and hide among thousands of legitimate tasks. Hunt for tasks with odd actions, odd principals, or creation outside change windows. Applies to Mobile Devices (MDM) in Colocation Facilities at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- 4698 (scheduled task created) with actions pointing at temp directories, encoded PowerShell, or LOLBins, especially running as SYSTEM.
- Tasks with misleading names mimicking legitimate ones (e.g., 'GoogleUpdateTaskMachineUA' in the wrong path), or tasks created outside maintenance windows.
- Task XML in C:\Windows\System32\Tasks with recent timestamps but no corresponding change record.
- Lens: Best telemetry: MDM compliance/app inventory + mobile threat defense alerts + enrollment logs. Customer-owned network taps and logging (the colo provider's logs are out of scope — verify contractually).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Badge/physical access logs from the facility correlated with remote-hand ticket times.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in MDM device inventory: OS versions, jailbreak/root detections, installed app lists and Mobile threat defense alerts (malicious apps, network attacks, OS tampering); run `# conceptually (MDM APIs differ):` then `mdm-cli devices list --noncompliant --limit 30`.
3. **Analyze.** Export the task XML and inspect actions, triggers, principals, and conditions — the full task definition is the evidence. Then: Determine creation vector: who/what created it (user, GPO, remote RPC) to find the still-active access path.
4. **Contain and harden.** Alert on 4698/4702 fleet-wide; restrict task creation rights and audit tasks running as SYSTEM quarterly. Asset layer: Enrollment required for corporate data, OS version minimums, jailbreak/root = automatic quarantine. Environment layer: Locked cabinets, private cages, and escort policies for remote hands.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Deleting the task but leaving the payload binary — many implants re-create their task on next execution.
- Trusting the task name; always inspect the action path and hash.
