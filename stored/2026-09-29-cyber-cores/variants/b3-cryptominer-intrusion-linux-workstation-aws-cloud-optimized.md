# Cryptominer Intrusion Defense for Linux Workstations in AWS Cloud (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Unauthorized miners burn CPU/GPU and cloud spend, and — more importantly — prove an attacker has code execution on your assets. Treat every miner as a foothold to investigate, not just a performance problem. Applies to Linux Workstations in AWS Cloud at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- Sustained high CPU/GPU on hosts or cloud instances with no business workload, especially at night/weekends, plus connections to known mining pools on Stratum ports.
- Cloud billing spikes for compute in regions you do not use, or new instances launched by unfamiliar principals.
- EDR detections for xmrig or similar binaries, scheduled tasks re-fetching miner payloads, or WMI persistence entries.
- Lens: Best telemetry: auditd user-session logging + EDR agent + desktop shell histories (with user notice). Organization CloudTrail in all regions, GuardDuty, and VPC flow logs shipped to the security account.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to CloudWatch and workload logs centralized; S3 access logging on sensitive buckets.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in User shell histories (~/.bash_history), desktop autostart entries (~/.config/autostart/) and auditd execve logs and USB device logs; browser profiles for web-vector cases; run `ls -la ~/.config/autostart/ 2>/dev/null; grep -r 'Exec=' ~/.config/autostart/ 2>/dev/null` then `sudo ausearch --start recent -m EXECVE -i | tail -30`.
3. **Analyze.** Trace the miner's persistence and delivery: the initial access vector (exposed service, weak SSH, vulnerable app) matters more than the miner itself. Then: Check for dual-use: many miner campaigns also exfiltrate credentials or deploy additional payloads — sweep for those.
4. **Contain and harden.** Close the entry vector (patch the exploited service, enforce key-based SSH, remove internet exposure), then block mining pool domains at DNS. Asset layer: Standard user accounts for daily work, full-disk encryption, and screen-lock enforcement. Environment layer: SCPs as guardrails (deny leaving org, deny disabling logging, region restrictions).
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Killing the miner without removing persistence — it returns on reboot or on schedule.
- Writing it off as 'just a miner' without investigating the initial access that delivered it.
