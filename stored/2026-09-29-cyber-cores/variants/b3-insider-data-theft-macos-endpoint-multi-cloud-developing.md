# Insider Data Theft Defense for macOS Endpoints in Multi-Cloud (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

A trusted user steals data — often before resignation. Unlike external attacks there is no malware to find; detection relies on behavioral baselines: access volume, off-hours activity, and personal-storage uploads. Handle with HR and legal from the start. Applies to macOS Endpoints in Multi-Cloud at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- A user accessing far more files or records than their role baseline, especially in the 30 days before resignation or termination.
- Bulk downloads to USB, personal cloud uploads, or emailing attachments to personal addresses from a corporate account.
- Off-hours access to repositories the user never touched before, or permission changes granting themselves broader access.
- Lens: Best telemetry: unified log + EDR agent + Santa/Munki logs where deployed. Cloud-agnostic SIEM normalizing AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Log, and GCP Audit Logs into one schema.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to CSPM coverage across all clouds with consistent misconfiguration alerting.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Unified log (log show) for process execution and auth events; login items and LaunchAgents/LaunchDaemons plists and Quarantine attributes (xattr com.apple.quarantine) on downloads; Gatekeeper assessment history; run `log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "sshd"' --last 2h | tail -20` then `ls -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ /Library/LaunchDaemons/ /Library/LaunchAgents/ 2>/dev/null`.
3. **Analyze.** Build a 90-day access timeline for the user: volume, data sensitivity, destination (USB serial, cloud account, personal email) — coordinate collection with HR/legal to stay compliant. Then: Determine business justification for each anomaly with the user's manager before concluding malice; over-collection without cause creates liability.
4. **Contain and harden.** UEBA baselines with alerting on pre-resignation access spikes; disable USB mass storage or enforce encryption + logging. Asset layer: Gatekeeper + XProtect current, FileVault on, firewall on, and MDM-enforced configuration profiles. Environment layer: Federated identity across clouds from one IdP; consistent tagging and logging standards per cloud.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Investigating without HR/legal involvement — privacy and employment law exposure is real.
- Confronting the user before evidence is preserved; they will delete local copies first.
