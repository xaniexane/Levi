# Kerberoasting Defense for Message Queues in On-Premises Datacenter (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers request service tickets for SPN accounts and crack them offline to recover service-account passwords — no alerts on the DC, because requesting tickets is normal. The defense is making those passwords uncrackable and the requests visible. Applies to Message Queues in On-Premises Datacenter at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- A single account requesting an unusual number of service tickets (4769) with RC4 encryption for many different SPNs in a short window.
- Ticket requests for SPNs from accounts with no business need, or requests at odd hours from a workstation (not a server).
- Subsequent use of a cracked service account: logons from unexpected hosts or privilege changes for that account.
- Lens: Best telemetry: queue depth/lag metrics + producer/consumer auth logs + dead-letter queues. Full network tap/SPAN coverage at core and distribution layers feeding IDS and full-packet capture.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Centralized syslog from all infrastructure with NTP-synced timestamps for cross-device correlation.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Queue metrics: depth spikes, consumer lag, and poison-message dead-letter queues and Authentication logs for producers/consumers; new queue/topic creation events; run `rabbitmqctl list_queues name messages consumers 2>/dev/null | head -20` then `kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server <broker> --describe --all-groups 2>/dev/null | head -20`.
3. **Analyze.** List every SPN targeted and assess the crackability of each service account's password (length, complexity, age). Then: If a service account was cracked, treat it as full compromise: inventory everything that account could touch.
4. **Contain and harden.** Service accounts: 25+ character random passwords, or better, group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) with automatic rotation. Asset layer: Authentication on all clients, TLS in transit, authorization per queue/topic, quotas on producers. Environment layer: Physical access controls with badge logs correlatable to logical access during investigations.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Rotating the password but leaving the SPN on a weak account — the attacker just roasts it again.
- Missing that the cracked service account may have been used to request MORE tickets (roast chaining).
