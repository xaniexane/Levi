# Malicious Service Persistence Defense for Backup Servers in Air-Gapped Networks (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers install or hijack Windows services for SYSTEM-level, reboot-surviving execution. Services are trusted by admins, so malicious ones hide with plausible names — verify the binary, not the display name. Applies to Backup Servers in Air-Gapped Networks at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- 7045 (service installed) with ImagePath in user-writable or temp directories, unsigned binaries, or names mimicking legit services.
- Existing service ImagePath changed (7045 with same name, new binary) or service binary replaced on disk.
- Services running as SYSTEM that were recently created and have no vendor documentation or change record.
- Lens: Best telemetry: job audit logs + admin-console access logs + integrity-check results. Local SIEM/log collector inside the enclave (no cloud shipping); removable-media transfer logs.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Strict allowlisting logs: every binary execution recorded, since the set is small and known.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Backup job definitions, run histories, and deletion/retention-change audit entries and Admin console logons and configuration exports; repository credential-change history; run `# conceptually (product CLIs differ):` then `backup-cli jobs list --failed --last 7d`.
3. **Analyze.** Hash and detonate the service binary; check its signature status and first-seen date in threat intel. Then: Review the service account: LocalSystem services have maximum impact — scope accordingly.
4. **Contain and harden.** Alert on all 7045 events; require change tickets for new services and run services as least-privilege virtual accounts. Asset layer: Immutable storage, separate admin credentials with MFA, no domain-joined backup console if avoidable. Environment layer: Data diodes or strictly controlled one-way transfers; media sanitization procedures for anything crossing.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Stopping the service without deleting it — it restarts on reboot.
- Missing service DLL hijacking (Services with ServiceDll in writable paths) while hunting only EXE-based services.
