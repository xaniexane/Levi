# Pass-the-Hash Defense for IoT Device Fleets in On-Premises Datacenter (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Stolen NTLM hashes authenticate without the password ever being cracked. It is invisible to password monitoring because no password is used — defense means killing NTLM where possible and watching for its telltale logon patterns. Applies to IoT Device Fleets in On-Premises Datacenter at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- 4624 type-3/9 logons using NTLM where Kerberos is expected, especially from workstations to servers with admin accounts.
- Logon sessions with no interactive activity but successful authentication, or the same hash authenticating from multiple hosts simultaneously.
- NTLM audit logs showing authentication for accounts that should be Kerberos-only.
- Lens: Best telemetry: device heartbeat/status + firmware version inventory + network flow from IoT VLAN. Full network tap/SPAN coverage at core and distribution layers feeding IDS and full-packet capture.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Centralized syslog from all infrastructure with NTP-synced timestamps for cross-device correlation.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Device inventory with firmware versions and last-seen timestamps and Network flows from the IoT segment (unexpected destinations, scanning behavior); run `nmap -sn 192.0.2.0/24 2>/dev/null | grep -E 'Nmap scan|MAC' | head -40   # authorized scan only` then `grep <device-ip> /var/log/iot-flows.log | awk '{print $5}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -15`.
3. **Analyze.** Determine hash source: LSASS dump, SAM extraction, or DCSync — each implies a different prior compromise to remediate. Then: List every host the hash authenticated to; each is a foothold until reimaged or verified clean.
4. **Contain and harden.** Reduce NTLM usage (audit mode first, then restrict), deploy Credential Guard, and use unique local admin passwords (LAPS). Asset layer: Dedicated VLAN with no internet egress except via proxy, unique credentials per device, firmware update process. Environment layer: Physical access controls with badge logs correlatable to logical access during investigations.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Resetting the password without considering that the attacker may have dumped the NEW hash too if still present.
- Disabling NTLM blindly and breaking legacy apps — audit first, restrict second.
