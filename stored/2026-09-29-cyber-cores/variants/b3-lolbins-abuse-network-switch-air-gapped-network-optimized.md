# Living-off-the-Land Binaries Abuse Defense for Network Switches in Air-Gapped Networks (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers use built-in tools (certutil, bitsadmin, mshta, rundll32, wmic) for download, execution, and exfiltration — no malware to signature. Defense is behavioral: baseline normal LOLBin usage and alert on anomalous parents, arguments, and network activity. Applies to Network Switches in Air-Gapped Networks at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- LOLBins spawned by Office apps, browsers, or scripts with network arguments (certutil -urlcache, bitsadmin /transfer) — parents that never legitimately drive them.
- Encoded or obfuscated arguments, downloads to temp/appdata, or LOLBin-initiated outbound connections.
- Rare LOLBins (mshta, regsvr32, cmstp) executing at all in environments that never use them legitimately.
- Lens: Best telemetry: syslog (port up/down, STP changes, config changes) + SNMP/NetFlow + NAC logs. Local SIEM/log collector inside the enclave (no cloud shipping); removable-media transfer logs.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Strict allowlisting logs: every binary execution recorded, since the set is small and known.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Syslog: link-state changes, MAC flaps, STP topology changes, login attempts and MAC address tables and ARP tables for device-to-port mapping during incidents; run `show mac address-table | include <suspect-mac>` then `show logging | include %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP|%PORT_SECURITY`.
3. **Analyze.** Reconstruct the full command line — the arguments reveal intent (download URL, payload path, execution method). Then: Check whether the LOLBin fetched a second stage; if so, the investigation continues at the downloaded payload.
4. **Contain and harden.** Application control policies blocking LOLBin network/download primitives where unused; constrained language mode for PowerShell. Asset layer: Port security / 802.1X on access ports, BPDU guard, DHCP snooping + dynamic ARP inspection. Environment layer: Data diodes or strictly controlled one-way transfers; media sanitization procedures for anything crossing.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Blocking a LOLBin outright and breaking admin workflows — constrain by parent and argument, not by existence.
- Missing LOLBin use on Linux/macOS (curl, wget, python) while hunting Windows only.
