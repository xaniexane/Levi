# Active Directory ACL Abuse Defense for Windows Servers in Branch Offices (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers abuse delegated Active Directory permissions — WriteDacl, GenericAll, ForceChangePassword — to escalate without exploits. These are legitimate rights granted too broadly, so detection means auditing WHO can do WHAT, continuously. Applies to Windows Servers in Branch Offices at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- 4662 events showing writes to security descriptors (WriteDacl / WriteOwner) on privileged groups, OUs, or the AdminSDHolder container.
- Password resets (4724) performed by non-helpdesk accounts, or new ACEs granting GenericAll over high-value targets.
- BloodHound-style LDAP enumeration (large object reads) preceding the ACL change — the attacker mapping attack paths.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Security log with advanced audit policy + Sysmon + service-install monitoring. SD-WAN/branch firewall logs forwarded centrally; local DHCP/DNS logs for device attribution.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NAC or port-level logs identifying which device was on which port during the incident.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Security log (7045 service installs, 4720 account creation, 4732 group changes) and IIS/HTTP.sys logs for web-facing roles; scheduled-task store in C:\Windows\System32\Tasks; run `Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='System'; Id=7045} | Select-Object -First 20 TimeCreated, Message` then `Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq 'Running'} | ForEach-Object { Get-CimInstance Win32_Service -Filter "Name='$($_.Name)'" | Select-Object Name, PathName, StartName }`.
3. **Analyze.** Diff the object's ACL before and after: which principal gained which right, and was it granted through nested group membership? Then: Map the attack path the new right enables (e.g., GenericAll on a group -> add self -> Domain Admin) to scope the blast radius.
4. **Contain and harden.** Least-privilege delegation: no GenericAll/WriteDacl outside Domain Admins; regular ACL audits with alerting on changes to protected objects. Asset layer: Server Core installs where possible; disable unnecessary roles and SMBv1; enforce SMB signing. Environment layer: Standardized branch firewall policy deployed as code; no local admin exceptions.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- One-time ACL cleanup without continuous monitoring — delegation sprawl regrows within months.
- Forgetting nested groups: the dangerous ACE is often three group-nestings away from the attacker.
