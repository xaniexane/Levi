# Scheduled Task Persistence Defense for Linux Workstations in Hybrid Cloud (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Scheduled tasks are the most common Windows persistence: they survive reboots, run as SYSTEM, and hide among thousands of legitimate tasks. Hunt for tasks with odd actions, odd principals, or creation outside change windows. Applies to Linux Workstations in Hybrid Cloud at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- 4698 (scheduled task created) with actions pointing at temp directories, encoded PowerShell, or LOLBins, especially running as SYSTEM.
- Tasks with misleading names mimicking legitimate ones (e.g., 'GoogleUpdateTaskMachineUA' in the wrong path), or tasks created outside maintenance windows.
- Task XML in C:\Windows\System32\Tasks with recent timestamps but no corresponding change record.
- Lens: Best telemetry: auditd user-session logging + EDR agent + desktop shell histories (with user notice). Unified SIEM ingesting both on-prem syslog and cloud audit trails with identity correlation across both.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Conditional-access and network logs covering the interconnect (ExpressRoute/Direct Connect/VPN).

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in User shell histories (~/.bash_history), desktop autostart entries (~/.config/autostart/) and auditd execve logs and USB device logs; browser profiles for web-vector cases; run `ls -la ~/.config/autostart/ 2>/dev/null; grep -r 'Exec=' ~/.config/autostart/ 2>/dev/null` then `sudo ausearch --start recent -m EXECVE -i | tail -30`.
3. **Analyze.** Export the task XML and inspect actions, triggers, principals, and conditions — the full task definition is the evidence. Then: Determine creation vector: who/what created it (user, GPO, remote RPC) to find the still-active access path.
4. **Contain and harden.** Alert on 4698/4702 fleet-wide; restrict task creation rights and audit tasks running as SYSTEM quarterly. Asset layer: Standard user accounts for daily work, full-disk encryption, and screen-lock enforcement. Environment layer: Consistent identity (single IdP) across on-prem and cloud; no parallel credential stores.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Deleting the task but leaving the payload binary — many implants re-create their task on next execution.
- Trusting the task name; always inspect the action path and hash.
