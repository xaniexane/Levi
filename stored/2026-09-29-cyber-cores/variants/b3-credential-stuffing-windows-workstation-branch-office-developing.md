# Credential Stuffing Defense for Windows Workstations in Branch Offices (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers replay username/password pairs stolen from third-party breaches against your login endpoints, betting on password reuse. It shows up as high-volume failed logons from distributed IPs, occasionally followed by a small number of successful takeovers. Applies to Windows Workstations in Branch Offices at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- Authentication logs show a spike in failed logons (often 100s per minute) from many source IPs against a single login endpoint, with a low success rate and common password patterns.
- Successful logons immediately followed by password or MFA changes, mailbox rule creation, or impossible-travel alerts for the same account within minutes.
- WAF/bot-management flags distributed requests with identical user-agent strings, headless-browser markers, or known credential-stuffing tool signatures.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Sysmon + EDR + PowerShell script-block logging forwarded to the SIEM. SD-WAN/branch firewall logs forwarded centrally; local DHCP/DNS logs for device attribution.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NAC or port-level logs identifying which device was on which port during the incident.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Security event log (4624/4625 logons, 4688 process creation, 7045 service installs) and Sysmon operational log and PowerShell operational log (4104 script blocks); run `Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; Id=4625} -MaxEvents 50 | Format-List TimeCreated, @{n='TargetUser';e={$_.Properties[5].Value}}, @{n='SourceIP';e={$_.Properties[19].Value}}` then `autorunsc64.exe -accepteula -a * -c -h -s -t | findstr /v "Microsoft Corporation"`.
3. **Analyze.** Separate spray from stuffing: stuffing reuses many passwords per username from breach corpora; confirm by checking whether the attempted passwords appear in public breach datasets. Then: For each successful post-stuffing logon, inventory session actions: read mail rules, forwarding addresses, OAuth grants, and API keys created in the 24 hours after compromise.
4. **Contain and harden.** Enforce MFA everywhere and block legacy/basic authentication; stuffing dies against phishing-resistant MFA. Asset layer: Application allowlisting (WDAC/AppLocker) and LSA Protection + Credential Guard enabled. Environment layer: Standardized branch firewall policy deployed as code; no local admin exceptions.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Blocking single IPs is whack-a-mole against botnets; block on behavior (velocity, fingerprint) rather than address.
- Forcing a fleet-wide password reset without confirming which accounts were actually taken over burns goodwill and teaches users to pick weaker passwords.
