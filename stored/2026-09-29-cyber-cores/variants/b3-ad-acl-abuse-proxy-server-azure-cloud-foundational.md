# Active Directory ACL Abuse Defense for Proxy Servers in Azure Cloud (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers abuse delegated Active Directory permissions — WriteDacl, GenericAll, ForceChangePassword — to escalate without exploits. These are legitimate rights granted too broadly, so detection means auditing WHO can do WHAT, continuously. Applies to Proxy Servers in Azure Cloud at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- 4662 events showing writes to security descriptors (WriteDacl / WriteOwner) on privileged groups, OUs, or the AdminSDHolder container.
- Password resets (4724) performed by non-helpdesk accounts, or new ACEs granting GenericAll over high-value targets.
- BloodHound-style LDAP enumeration (large object reads) preceding the ACL change — the attacker mapping attack paths.
- Lens: Best telemetry: full URL logs with user identity + TLS SNI logs + block/allow verdicts. Activity Log and Entra sign-in/audit logs streamed to Log Analytics/SIEM; Defender for Cloud alerts.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NSG flow logs and storage analytics for data-plane visibility.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Access logs (user, URL, category, verdict, bytes) for the incident window and Blocked-request logs showing attempted C2/malware/phishing destinations; run `grep <username> /var/log/squid/access.log | awk '{print $7}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20` then `grep -E 'TCP_DENIED|BLOCK' /var/log/squid/access.log | tail -30`.
3. **Analyze.** Diff the object's ACL before and after: which principal gained which right, and was it granted through nested group membership? Then: Map the attack path the new right enables (e.g., GenericAll on a group -> add self -> Domain Admin) to scope the blast radius.
4. **Contain and harden.** Least-privilege delegation: no GenericAll/WriteDacl outside Domain Admins; regular ACL audits with alerting on changes to protected objects. Asset layer: Authenticated proxying (no anonymous egress), category blocking, TLS inspection where policy allows. Environment layer: Azure Policy deny-effects on risky configurations; PIM-gated subscription roles.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- One-time ACL cleanup without continuous monitoring — delegation sprawl regrows within months.
- Forgetting nested groups: the dangerous ACE is often three group-nestings away from the attacker.
