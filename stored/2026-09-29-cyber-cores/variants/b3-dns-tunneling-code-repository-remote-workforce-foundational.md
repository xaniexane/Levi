# DNS Tunneling Defense for Code Repositories in Remote Workforce (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

DNS tunneling smuggles data or C2 inside DNS queries, abusing a protocol almost every network allows outbound. Detection hinges on query shape (length, entropy, volume, record types), not on blocklists. Applies to Code Repositories in Remote Workforce at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- Long, high-entropy subdomains (often 50+ chars) in DNS logs, unusual record types (TXT, NULL) at volume, or a single host generating thousands of queries to one domain.
- Beacon-like regularity in query timing to an obscure domain, or DNS queries for domains registered within the last 30 days.
- Responses with abnormally large TXT records relative to the query — data coming back down the tunnel.
- Lens: Best telemetry: push/audit logs + secret-scanning alerts + branch-protection change history. EDR on every endpoint as the primary sensor (no corporate network tap for remote hosts).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to VPN/ZTNA access logs and SaaS/IdP sign-in logs as the network-visibility substitute.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Push logs (who pushed what to which branch), force-push and history-rewrite records and Secret-scanning and code-scanning alerts with their resolution state; run `git log --since='7 days ago' --format='%h %an %ad %s' --date=short | head -30` then `git log --all --diff-filter=A -- '*secret*' '*credential*' '*key*' --format='%h %an %s' | head -20`.
3. **Analyze.** Decode a sample of tunneled queries/responses in a sandbox to determine direction and content: C2 instructions, exfiltrated data, or both. Then: Identify patient zero by earliest query timestamp, then hunt laterally: tunneling tools are often deployed to multiple hosts.
4. **Contain and harden.** Force all DNS through logged, filtered resolvers; block direct port-53 egress from endpoints and alert on non-standard DNS ports. Asset layer: Branch protection with required reviews, signed commits, push protection for secrets. Environment layer: Zero-trust access: device compliance + MFA per application, not per network.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Blocking the domain without finding the implant — the attacker rotates domains faster than you blocklist.
- Ignoring DNS over HTTPS (DoH): tunneled traffic inside DoH is invisible to passive DNS monitoring — log at the endpoint.
