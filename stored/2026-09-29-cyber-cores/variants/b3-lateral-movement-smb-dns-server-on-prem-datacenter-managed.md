# SMB Lateral Movement Defense for DNS Servers in On-Premises Datacenter (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers move host-to-host over SMB using stolen credentials — PsExec-style service creation, admin shares, or WMI. In a flat network, one compromised workstation becomes the whole domain in hours. Applies to DNS Servers in On-Premises Datacenter at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- SMB sessions from a workstation to many other hosts in a short window, especially to ADMIN$ or C$ shares the user never touches normally.
- Service creation events (7045) with service binaries in ADMIN$\system32, or 4624 type-3 logons with the same account across dozens of hosts.
- EDR process trees showing services.exe spawning cmd/powershell shortly after a remote SMB session.
- Lens: Best telemetry: query logs (or passive DNS) + zone-transfer/change audit + resolver cache stats. Full network tap/SPAN coverage at core and distribution layers feeding IDS and full-packet capture.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Centralized syslog from all infrastructure with NTP-synced timestamps for cross-device correlation.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in DNS query logs showing tunneling/DGA patterns; zone files and their change history and Zone-transfer (AXFR) request logs; DNSSEC validation failure logs; run `grep -E '.{60,}' /var/log/named/query.log | tail -20   # long labels: tunneling/DGA` then `rndc status; echo ---; journalctl -u named --since '1 hour ago' | grep -iE 'transfer|denied|error' | tail -15`.
3. **Analyze.** Map the movement graph: source host, credential used, target hosts, timestamps — this is the incident's skeleton. Then: Determine which credential enabled it (stolen hash, ticket, or plaintext) to know what must be rotated enterprise-wide.
4. **Contain and harden.** Segment the network (workstation-to-workstation SMB blocked), deploy LAPS for unique local admin passwords, and restrict lateral logon rights via tiered admin model. Asset layer: Restrict recursion to internal clients, block outbound port 53 except resolvers, DNSSEC validation on. Environment layer: Physical access controls with badge logs correlatable to logical access during investigations.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Cleaning patient zero while the attacker's beachheads on hosts 3, 7, and 12 remain active.
- Rotating the compromised account's password but not the kerberos tickets/hashes already stolen from it.
