# Backup Tampering Defense for SaaS Applications in Hybrid Cloud (Developing Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers delete, encrypt, or corrupt backups before the main attack so recovery is impossible. Backup systems are targeted FIRST in modern ransomware — monitor them as the crown jewels they are. Applies to SaaS Applications in Hybrid Cloud at Developing maturity.

## When to use

- Backup job deletions, retention policy changes, or repository credential changes outside change windows.
- Backup admin console logons from unusual accounts or hosts, or mass snapshot deletions in cloud backup vaults.
- Backup integrity check failures or sudden drops in restorable recovery points.
- Lens: Best telemetry: SaaS audit logs (admin + user activity) streamed to SIEM + SSO logs. Unified SIEM ingesting both on-prem syslog and cloud audit trails with identity correlation across both.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Conditional-access and network logs covering the interconnect (ExpressRoute/Direct Connect/VPN).

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Admin audit log (settings changes, user provisioning, sharing changes) and User activity logs: file access, downloads, external sharing events; run `# conceptually (SaaS APIs differ):` then `saas-cli audit log --category admin --last 7d --format table | head -25`.
3. **Analyze.** Determine which recovery points were destroyed versus merely marked deleted — cloud soft-delete and immutable vaults may still hold copies. Then: Identify how the attacker reached the backup system: shared credentials, unpatched console, or compromised admin.
4. **Contain and harden.** Immutable backup storage (object lock / immutable vaults) with separate credentials and MFA on the backup console. Asset layer: SSO with MFA enforced, SCIM provisioning, least-privilege roles, external-sharing restricted. Environment layer: Consistent identity (single IdP) across on-prem and cloud; no parallel credential stores.
5. **Document and improve.** Assign RACI for each procedure step (who detects, who contains, who communicates) and rehearse it quarterly. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Backups on the same domain credentials as production — the attacker uses the same keys on both.
- Monitoring backup job success but never testing an actual restore.
