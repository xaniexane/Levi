# Cryptominer Intrusion Defense for Web Applications in Azure Cloud (Managed Maturity)

## Purpose

Unauthorized miners burn CPU/GPU and cloud spend, and — more importantly — prove an attacker has code execution on your assets. Treat every miner as a foothold to investigate, not just a performance problem. Applies to Web Applications in Azure Cloud at Managed maturity.

## When to use

- Sustained high CPU/GPU on hosts or cloud instances with no business workload, especially at night/weekends, plus connections to known mining pools on Stratum ports.
- Cloud billing spikes for compute in regions you do not use, or new instances launched by unfamiliar principals.
- EDR detections for xmrig or similar binaries, scheduled tasks re-fetching miner payloads, or WMI persistence entries.
- Lens: Best telemetry: app audit logs (with authenticated identity) + WAF logs + structured access logs. Activity Log and Entra sign-in/audit logs streamed to Log Analytics/SIEM; Defender for Cloud alerts.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NSG flow logs and storage analytics for data-plane visibility.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Application audit log: who did what to which object, with session IDs and source IPs and WAF block logs and anomaly scores; web-server access/error logs around the incident; run `grep -E ' 4[0-9]{2} | 5[0-9]{2} ' /var/log/nginx/access.log | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -15` then `journalctl -u myapp --since '2 hours ago' | grep -iE 'error|unauthor|exception' | tail -30`.
3. **Analyze.** Trace the miner's persistence and delivery: the initial access vector (exposed service, weak SSH, vulnerable app) matters more than the miner itself. Then: Check for dual-use: many miner campaigns also exfiltrate credentials or deploy additional payloads — sweep for those.
4. **Contain and harden.** Close the entry vector (patch the exploited service, enforce key-based SSH, remove internet exposure), then block mining pool domains at DNS. Asset layer: Authorization checks on every object reference, output encoding, parameterized queries, secure session handling. Environment layer: Azure Policy deny-effects on risky configurations; PIM-gated subscription roles.
5. **Document and improve.** Pre-authorize low-risk containment (host isolation, session revoke, password reset) in the SOAR playbook with full audit logging. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Killing the miner without removing persistence — it returns on reboot or on schedule.
- Writing it off as 'just a miner' without investigating the initial access that delivered it.
