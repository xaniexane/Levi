# Supply Chain Compromise Defense for OT Controllers in Colocation Facilities (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Trusted software updates or vendor components carry the attacker's payload — the hardest vector to prevent, because the malware arrives signed and expected. Defense shifts to verification, segmentation, and vendor scrutiny. Applies to OT Controllers in Colocation Facilities at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- A signed, trusted application suddenly exhibiting C2 communication or spawning unexpected children after an update.
- Threat intel or vendor advisory naming a specific product version as compromised.
- Anomalous behavior correlated tightly with a software update timestamp across many hosts.
- Lens: Best telemetry: passive OT network monitoring + engineering-workstation logs + change-management records. Customer-owned network taps and logging (the colo provider's logs are out of scope — verify contractually).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Badge/physical access logs from the facility correlated with remote-hand ticket times.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in OT protocol logs (Modbus/DNP3/OPC) from passive taps — never active-scan OT networks and Engineering workstation access and project-file change logs; run `# PASSIVE ONLY on OT networks — no active scanning:` then `tshark -r /captures/ot-span.pcap -Y 'modbus' -T fields -e frame.time -e modbus.func_code 2>/dev/null | head -20`.
3. **Analyze.** Identify the trojanized version and enumerate every host that installed it — the exposure list defines the response scope. Then: Determine what the implanted component could access (its privilege level and data reach) to bound the impact.
4. **Contain and harden.** Software allowlisting with version pinning; staged update rollouts with behavioral monitoring before fleet-wide deploy. Asset layer: Air-gap or data-diode segmentation from IT, unidirectional gateways, strict change control on logic. Environment layer: Locked cabinets, private cages, and escort policies for remote hands.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Assuming signed = safe; supply-chain malware is signed by definition.
- Delaying response waiting for the vendor's statement while the implant remains active.
