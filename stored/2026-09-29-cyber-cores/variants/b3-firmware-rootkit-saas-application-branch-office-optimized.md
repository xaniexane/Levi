# Firmware Rootkit Defense for SaaS Applications in Branch Offices (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Malware in UEFI/BIOS or device firmware survives OS reinstalls and disk replacements. Rare but devastating — detection needs firmware measurement (TPM attestation) and dedicated scanning, not standard AV. Applies to SaaS Applications in Branch Offices at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- CHIPSEC or firmware-scanner findings of modified UEFI modules, unexpected DXE drivers, or Secure Boot disabled without authorization.
- TPM attestation failures or PCR values deviating from the known-good baseline for the hardware model.
- Persistence surviving full disk wipe and OS reinstall — the hallmark symptom.
- Lens: Best telemetry: SaaS audit logs (admin + user activity) streamed to SIEM + SSO logs. SD-WAN/branch firewall logs forwarded centrally; local DHCP/DNS logs for device attribution.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to NAC or port-level logs identifying which device was on which port during the incident.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Admin audit log (settings changes, user provisioning, sharing changes) and User activity logs: file access, downloads, external sharing events; run `# conceptually (SaaS APIs differ):` then `saas-cli audit log --category admin --last 7d --format table | head -25`.
3. **Analyze.** Dump the firmware image (with authorization) and diff against the vendor's known-good image for the exact board and version. Then: Determine the implant's capabilities: network, persistence mechanism, and whether it targets other hosts (some spread via firmware update mechanisms).
4. **Contain and harden.** Enable Secure Boot + TPM measured boot fleet-wide; lock BIOS with admin passwords and signed firmware updates only. Asset layer: SSO with MFA enforced, SCIM provisioning, least-privilege roles, external-sharing restricted. Environment layer: Standardized branch firewall policy deployed as code; no local admin exceptions.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Reinstalling the OS repeatedly while the firmware implant re-infects each build.
- Running firmware scans from the potentially compromised OS — use offline/BIOS-level tooling.
