# Cloud Console Takeover Defense for EDR Consoles in Multi-Cloud (Optimized Maturity)

## Purpose

Stolen cloud credentials used in the web console give attackers point-and-click infrastructure control. Console logons from unusual locations followed by IAM changes are the classic takeover sequence. Applies to EDR Consoles in Multi-Cloud at Optimized maturity.

## When to use

- CloudTrail/Entra sign-in logs showing console logons from new countries or anonymizing services for privileged users.
- IAM policy changes, new access keys, or new users created within minutes of the anomalous logon.
- Disabling of CloudTrail/logging or deletion of log data — the attacker covering tracks.
- Lens: Best telemetry: raw process/network telemetry + detection history + sensor health inventory. Cloud-agnostic SIEM normalizing AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Log, and GCP Audit Logs into one schema.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to CSPM coverage across all clouds with consistent misconfiguration alerting.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Full process trees with command lines, hashes, and network connections for suspect hosts and Detection and response action history (isolations, kills, quarantines); run `# conceptually (EDR APIs differ):` then `edr-cli hunt process --hostname <host> --since 24h --tree`.
3. **Analyze.** Reconstruct the full API call sequence after takeover: what was created, modified, exfiltrated, or destroyed. Then: Check for persistence: new IAM users, roles with trust policies pointing outward, or modified instance user-data.
4. **Contain and harden.** Phishing-resistant MFA on all console users, especially root/ break-glass; SCPs preventing logging disablement. Asset layer: Tamper protection locked with console-only disable, auto-isolation policies for high-severity detections. Environment layer: Federated identity across clouds from one IdP; consistent tagging and logging standards per cloud.
5. **Document and improve.** Feed incident lessons back into detection-as-code within one sprint — the playbook is a living document, not a PDF. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Rotating the compromised user's keys but missing the backdoor IAM role the attacker created.
- Trusting the account's own logs after the attacker had admin — verify against the immutable archive.
