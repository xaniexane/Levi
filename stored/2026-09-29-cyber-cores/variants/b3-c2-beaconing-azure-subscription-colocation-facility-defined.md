# C2 Beaconing Defense for Azure Subscriptions in Colocation Facilities (Defined Maturity)

## Purpose

Compromised hosts check in with attacker infrastructure on a schedule — the heartbeat of an intrusion. Beaconing detection is statistical: regularity, jitter analysis, and connection uniformity reveal what signatures miss. Applies to Azure Subscriptions in Colocation Facilities at Defined maturity.

## When to use

- Outbound connections at fixed intervals (e.g., every 60s) with consistent byte counts to an external host — visible in NetFlow or proxy logs as metronomic traffic.
- Long-lived sessions to IPs with no domain, newly registered domains, or domains with no legitimate business purpose.
- Jittered but statistically regular timing: inter-arrival times clustering around a mean with small variance.
- Lens: Best telemetry: Activity Log + Entra sign-in logs + Defender for Cloud + NSG flow logs. Customer-owned network taps and logging (the colo provider's logs are out of scope — verify contractually).

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Badge/physical access logs from the facility correlated with remote-hand ticket times.

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Azure Activity Log (write/delete on IAM, policy, network) and Entra audit/sign-in logs and Defender for Cloud recommendations and alerts; resource-change history; run `az monitor activity-log list --max-events 25 --query '[].{time:eventTimestamp, op:operationName.value, caller:caller}' -o table` then `az security alert list --query '[].{name:alertDisplayName, severity:severity, time:timeGeneratedUtc}' -o table`.
3. **Analyze.** Compute inter-arrival statistics on the suspect flows; true beacons show low variance even with jitter, unlike human browsing. Then: Capture the beacon payload in a sandbox detonation to identify the implant family and its tasking protocol.
4. **Contain and harden.** Egress filtering: default-deny outbound with allowlisted destinations for servers; alert on direct-to-IP connections. Asset layer: Azure Policy deny-effects on public storage/exposure; PIM for subscription roles; Defender plans on. Environment layer: Locked cabinets, private cages, and escort policies for remote hands.
5. **Document and improve.** Map each detection signal to the relevant MITRE technique and confirm coverage in the detection engineering backlog. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Chasing the C2 IP instead of the implant — infrastructure is disposable, the foothold is what matters.
- Assuming encrypted traffic cannot be analyzed: timing, size, and destination metadata still betray beacons.
