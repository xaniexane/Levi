# Token Impersonation Defense for EDR Consoles in Hybrid Cloud (Foundational Maturity)

## Purpose

Attackers steal or duplicate Windows access tokens to act as another user — often SYSTEM — without knowing any password. EDR sees odd parent/child relationships and token-privilege enabling that legitimate software rarely performs. Applies to EDR Consoles in Hybrid Cloud at Foundational maturity.

## When to use

- Processes enabling SeDebugPrivilege or SeImpersonatePrivilege outside of known admin tooling, or unexpected token duplication API sequences in EDR telemetry.
- A low-privilege process spawning children as SYSTEM or as another logged-on user without a legitimate service path.
- Named-pipe impersonation patterns (PrintSpooler-style) from non-printer processes.
- Lens: Best telemetry: raw process/network telemetry + detection history + sensor health inventory. Unified SIEM ingesting both on-prem syslog and cloud audit trails with identity correlation across both.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from the asset owner and incident commander before active containment.
- Access to Conditional-access and network logs covering the interconnect (ExpressRoute/Direct Connect/VPN).

## Procedure

1. **Authorize and scope.** Open a ticket, confirm written authorization, and preserve evidence before changing anything.
2. **Detect and collect.** Hunt the signals above in Full process trees with command lines, hashes, and network connections for suspect hosts and Detection and response action history (isolations, kills, quarantines); run `# conceptually (EDR APIs differ):` then `edr-cli hunt process --hostname <host> --since 24h --tree`.
3. **Analyze.** Trace the token source: which process's token was stolen, and did that source process itself get compromised first? Then: Check what the impersonated context accessed — file, registry, and network actions taken as the victim identity.
4. **Contain and harden.** Remove SeImpersonatePrivilege from service accounts that do not need it; patch print-spooler-class vulnerabilities promptly. Asset layer: Tamper protection locked with console-only disable, auto-isolation policies for high-severity detections. Environment layer: Consistent identity (single IdP) across on-prem and cloud; no parallel credential stores.
5. **Document and improve.** Define one escalation trigger in advance (e.g., confirmed credential theft, more than 3 hosts) that moves the case from analyst to incident commander. Record the timeline, indicators, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Expected outputs

- Scoped timeline; affected assets, accounts, and data with containment status each.
- Hardening verified effective; detection improvements filed.

## Pitfalls

- Assuming token theft requires admin — some impersonation primitives work from lower privilege.
- Missing that a stolen token can be replayed on OTHER hosts via remote authentication.
